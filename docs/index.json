These are the branch names:\n 1-starting-html 2-navigation-bar 3-introduction 4-about-section 5-contact-section 1. Adding some HTML to start ‚úèÔ∏è Open the repository in VSCode. Go to the file index.html. Add the following and save the changes:\n1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;assets/css/style.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; PLEASE CHANGE ME \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 8\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 10 11\u0026lt;!-- Leave this space empty for content --\u0026gt; 12 13\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 14\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; üìñ What does each of these lines mean?\n The page is defined as a HTML document:  1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;  The character set is defined as UTF-8:  \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026quot;UTF-8\u0026quot;\u0026gt; A meta viewport tag is used to ensure the site looks good on different screen sizes e.g. mobile, laptop:  \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026quot;viewport\u0026quot; content=\u0026quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\u0026quot;\u0026gt; A link to the CSS file we will use to style the site is added. This file is located elsewhere in the repository:  \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;assets/css/style.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; A title is added:  \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; PLEASE CHANGE ME \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; The visual website content will be contained within the body.

Open the terminal and cd into the website repository. Then type the following and copy the output:\npwd Open your browser and copy the following into the address bar (but replace the text enclosed in \u0026lt;\u0026gt; with the paste of your working directory):\nfile://\u0026lt;paste the pwd\u0026gt;/index.html You should see:\n The text in the tab says PLEASE CHANGE ME The webpage is blank  üé® Lastly, change the text PLEASE CHANGE ME in index.html to my website (or your preferred text), and refresh the page. What has changed?\n2. Navigation Bar (navbar) We have an empty webpage - so much space to fill! Let's start with a navbar.\nA navbar contains a list of the places to navigate to on a website e.g. Home, Notifications, Messages.\nOur website will contain three sections: Home, About and Contact.\nContent (HTML) ‚úèÔ∏è Add the following in between the two \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags (replacing the comment).\n1\u0026lt;!-- Header --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;header class=\u0026#34;intro\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;!-- Navbar --\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;navbar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#about\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#contact\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; üìñ What does this mean?\n The \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; tag is used to specify that a header is added to the page. This typically contains a navigation bar and/or introductory information.  1\u0026lt;header class=\u0026#34;intro\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2... 3\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; 4 The \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag represents a new section or division. The \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag is used to link from one page to another, or if a # is used, to link to another section on the same page. Later on we will create sections for About and Contact.  1 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;navbar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#about\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#contact\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Go to your browser and refresh the page to display this content. You will see that the navbar content is present but is unstyled, so we will add some styling with CSS.\nStyling (CSS) ‚úèÔ∏è In your IDE open the file: assets/css/style.css.\n Add the following to style and set a the colour of the navbar:  1body { 2 margin: 0px; 3} 4 5.navbar { 6 background-color: #5354f4; 7 overflow: hidden; 8} üé® The text #5354f4 represents a hex colour code. Use a colour picker to choose a different colour and change this!\nNext, style the navigation bar links by adding the following to style.css:  1/*Navigation bar links*/ 2.navbar a { 3 display: block; 4 padding: 20px 25px; 5 text-align: center; 6 text-decoration: none; 7 float: left; 8 color: white; 9} üé® For each of these items, see if you can figure out what it does either by making a search on Ecosia or by editing/removing them.\nLastly change what happens when a mouse is hovering over a link, by adding the following:  1/*Hovering over navigation bar*/ 2.navbar a:hover { 3 background-color: #faf800; 4 color: black; 5} üé® Again, change each of these to understand what they are doing.\n3. Adding an introduction header Within the header, we want to introduce ourselves and say hello to the world. We will add a greeting here.\nContent (HTML) ‚úèÔ∏è Return to the index.html file and add the following content after the navbar section and still between the \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; tags:\n1 \u0026lt;!-- Introduction --\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h1 class=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Hello, my name is ___ \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;h3 class=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;My title\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; The \u0026lt;h\u0026gt; tags are used to create different headings and subheadings. Here \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is used as the main heading, and \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt; as a subheading.\nüé® Now customise the greeting and title with your name and title e.g. your title could be Redi School Student, Programmer or even an emoji like: üíª.\nStyling (CSS) ‚úèÔ∏è Open style.css again.\nWe will change the font and position the intro text in the centre of the screen. Then we will add a background image.\n Change the font  Where you have previously, added:\nbody { margin: 0px; } Replace this with the following:\n1body, 2html { 3 height: 100%; 4 margin: 0px; 5} 6body, 7h1, 8h2, 9h3, 10h4, 11h5, 12h6, 13p { 14 font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 15 font-weight: 500; 16 color: #5354f4; 17} This will:\n make the body have 100% of the screen height. change the font for all text types to Arial, and change the text colour and weight.  üé® Again, customise the following:\n font font-weight colour  Now we will center the text in the screen  ‚úèÔ∏è Add the following to the CSS file:\n1/*Introduction*/ 2.summary { 3 position: absolute; 4 top: 50%; 5 left: 50%; 6 transform: translate(-50%,-50%); 7 8 text-align: center; 9 letter-spacing: 4px; 10} Read through each of these items. Can you figure out what each of them is doing? Try searching Ecosia, asking one of the instructors or experimenting by changing them.\nLastly, we will add a background image  For this, we will need the image that you selected as part of your preparation work.\nSave this image to the folder: assets/images and give it the name background.jpg (or if it is an png image, background.png)\n‚úèÔ∏è Now add the following to style.css:\n1.intro { 2 height: 100%; 3 background-image: url(\u0026#34;../images/background.png\u0026#34;); 4 background-size: cover; 5} If your background image has a .jpg extension, change this to url(\u0026quot;../images/background.jpg\u0026quot;);.\n4. About section ‚úèÔ∏è Next we will add an about section. Between the \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; tag and \u0026lt;/body tag, add the following:\nContent (HTML) 1\u0026lt;!-- About --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;about\u0026#34; id=about\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;About Me\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some things I like are ___ . I am learning about ____. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 5\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; üé® Customise the text between the \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; paragraph tags.\nStyling (CSS) ‚úèÔ∏è To style the text in the About section, add the following:\n1/*about section*/ 2 3.about h2, p { 4 text-align: left; 5 padding-left: 25%; 6 padding-top: 1%; 7 padding-bottom: 1%; 8 9} 10 11.about p { 12 font-size: 20px; 13} This will align the text and change the font size of the paragraph.\nüé® Change the font size and padding.\n5. Contact section Finally, we will add a Contact section with a list of links for how to contact us.\nContent (HTML) ‚úèÔ∏è Add the following underneath the About section:\n1\u0026lt;!-- Contact --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;div class = \u0026#34;contact\u0026#34; id=contact\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://github.com/\u0026lt;exampleuser\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;GitHub\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;mailto:example@email.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Email\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/\u0026lt;exampleuser\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Twitter\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; This creates a Contact section with an unordered list (\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;). Each list item \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; is a link to different forms of contact.\nüé® Customise this list by adding/removing/editting the contents, but don't add any contact details that you are not comfortable with.\nStyling (CSS) We will style the Contact section similiarly to the About section. The main difference is that this time we have a list and we want to style the list and its items.\n‚úèÔ∏è Add the following to the style.css document.\n1.contact h2, ul, li { 2 text-align: left; 3 padding-left: 25%; 4 padding-top: 1%; 5 padding-bottom: 1%; 6} 7 8.contact li { 9 padding-left: 1%; 10} 11 12.contact a { 13 border-bottom: dotted; 14 text-decoration: none; 15} üé® Learn what each of these is doing by customising the section, looking up what they mean or removing them entirely!\n6. Follow-up Here are some things you can do to continue your work:\n Compile a list of questions: what didn't you understand? Share the questions in the team slack. Remember if you are unsure about something, then someone else probably is too. Sharing questions openly helps everyone learn, including the teachers and instructors. Further customise the website by adding or removing sections, for example adding a section for photos or fun facts. Commit your changes and push your code to GitHub.

Install Git üíæ First! Check if you already have git installed, open your command line and run:\n1git --version If you see something like the following output then you already have git installed:\n1git version 2.x.x Otherwise, here are instructions to install Git:\n For Windows For MacOS  2. Sign up to GitHub üöÄ Sign up here: https://github.com/join\nWhy?\n We will use it in the class to store our code It can be used to collaborate with others It can be used to showcase your work  3. Watch the first 8:07 minutes of this video üìΩÔ∏è This Git and GitHub Tutorial For Beginners by Amigoscode.\nWhat you will learn:\n An overview of why Git and Github are so useful  You can watch the rest if you want, but for the purpose of the class, the first eight minutes are sufficient.\n4. Read this üìö Read this Introduction to Version Control and Git by CodeBar.\nWhat you will learn:\n What is version control? Why do we use it? Overview of Git as a version control system Overview of GitHub as a place to store code Common terminology   Class Curriculum    Section content Expected time (mins) Pre - Requirements     Review Learnings from Preparatory Materials 15 minutes video + article   Lesson Goals 5-10 minutes ‚ùå   Make a local repository and first commits 10-15 minutes git   Create a GitHub repository and push commits 10-15 minutes git and github   Class break 10 minutes ‚ùå   Make a branch and open a pull request 15-20 minutes git and github   Fork and clone a GitHub repository 10-15 minutes git and github   Wrap-up and next class overview 10-15 minutes ‚ùå    Lesson Goal Use Git and GitHub to make a profile README for your GitHub account.\n1. Create a local repository First, create a new directory and give it the same name as your GitHub username (the reason for this will become clear later):\n1mkdir \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Move into that directory\n1cd \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Initialise an empty git repository with the branch name, main:\n1git init -b main Now you have an empty local repository üéâ\n2. Make a commit Next, we want to make changes within this repository and save (or commit!) them.\nA commit is a way to save changes you‚Äôve made to a repository. It is powerful because it allows you to keep snapshots of your repository at any given time.\nFirst, we create a new file:\n1touch README.md This is a README file using markdown syntax.\nNext, we will add some text to this file to say hello to the world.\n1echo \u0026#34;# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; :)\u0026#34; \u0026gt; README.md Then view the status of the current git repository:\n1git status The README.md file will appear in the untracked files. We want to track this file and add it to the staging area so it will be included in the next commit:\n1git add . Then check the status again.\nLet's commit this file with a helpful commit message:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Initialise repository with a README\u0026#34; Finally, we can take a look at the log, to view metadata about our previous commits:\n1git log 3. Create a remote repository (on GitHub) Sign in to GitHub: https://github.com\nOn the top navigation bar, click the + button and select ‚ÄòNew repository‚Äô\nCreate a new repository: Give the repository the same name as your username, make sure it is ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô then click ‚ÄòCreate repository‚Äô.\n4. Push the contents of your local repository to the remote Now we want to associate our local repository with the one we have created on GitHub and push the contents of our local repository to GitHub.\nConnect the local repository with the remote repository:\n1git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git Verify that the remote was added:\n1git remote -v You should see the following output:\n1origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (fetch) 2origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (push) Finally push your changes to GitHub:\n1git push -u origin main Check your GitHub repository to see if it contains your README file, and look at your profile to see that it is displayed!\nWell done on sharing your first repository üéâ\n5. Create a branch Now we want to make some changes to our README, but we don't want to commit them to the main branch yet. Therefore, we will use another branch.\nCreate a new branch, called ‚Äòadd-more-detail‚Äô:\n1git checkout -b add-more-detail Open the README.md file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad or TextEdit) and make some changes. Here is a template you can use:\n1# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; üëã 2 3Pronouns: \u0026lt;your pronouns\u0026gt; 4Learning: command line, Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python 5Interests: \u0026lt;your interests\u0026gt; You can be as creative as you want by adding text, emoji, images or gifs (and more!).\nOnce you have made some changes it is time to add and commit them:\n1git add . 2git commit -m \u0026#34;Add some new information\u0026#34; Then push the branch with the changes to the remote repository:\n1git push origin add-more-detail Take a look at your README profile - has it been updated?\n6. Create a pull request Let's say we want to get feedback on the changes we've made. We can do this with a Pull Request.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch. Select 'Create new pull request'.\nAssign the person you are paired with to review your pull request.\nReviewing a pull request If somebody has requested your feedback, you can use this as an opportunity to:\n Ask questions and provide feedback about the changes Approve the changes Request further changes  Once you have reviewed the changes, click Review changes and then Approve.\nMerge a pull request Once your pull request has been reviewed, you can merge it so that the main branch is updated with your changes.\nOn your pull request, go to the bottom of the page and select Rebase and merge.\nYou can now go to your command line, checkout the main branch and pull the changes so that your local main branch is up to date:\n1git checkout main 2git pull origin main Finally, take a look at your updated GitHub profile README and celebrate what you've achieved!\n7. Fork and clone a repository Note üìù\nThis task is unrelated to the previous tasks, but has been included because these features are useful.\nA fork is a copy of someone else‚Äôs remote repository, sometimes you will make a fork to build on someone else's work.\nNavigate to https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife\nOn the top-right, select 'Fork'.\nOnce you have forked the repository, we can clone it to download a copy of the repository to your local machine. On the repository, select Code and copy the HTTPS link. Then navigate to your terminal and run:\n1git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git 8.

Command Line cheat sheet Go through the following commands and operators to remind yourself what each of them does, and when you would use them.\nRemember that you can look up what a command does by using the man (manual-pages) command on Mac and Linux, or help command on Windows cmd. For example: man echo would give you information on what the echo command does and how to use it.     command what it does     echo print some text   pwd print working directory (print the path to where I currently am in the file system)   ls list the contents of the directory   cd change directory (this moves you, the viewer of the terminal, to a new location in the file system)   cat print the contents of the file   cp copy a file (note: to copy a directory you probably need to add an option (like -r) to copy a directory)   mv move a file or directory to a new location (note: this can also be useful for changing the name of a file/directory)   mkdir make a directory   touch create a new file   rm delete a file (note: to delete a directory, add the option -r or -d)   \u0026gt; the redirection operator (X \u0026gt; Y will send the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will overwrite the existing file.)    1. Fork and clone repository First, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. (If you don't already have a designated folder for class materials, create a directory for this and navigate into it.) Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of another repository, usually one that is stored on a remote server like GitHub.\nFork this repository. In the top right corner, click Fork. You may be prompted with a question like \u0026quot;Where should we fork this repository to?\u0026quot; If so, click your GitHub username; this will create a copy of the repository to your account.\nYou should then be automatically taken to the main page of this repository. On the upper right side, click Code (in green) and copy the HTTPS link. Then in your terminal run git clone \u0026lt;link-you-copied\u0026gt;. For example, this should look something like the following (with github-username replaced with your own github username):\n1git clone https://github.com/github-username/intro-to-cs-git-review.git Check that this directory now exists. (Hint: list the contents of the directory you are in, and make sure you see the cloned folder.)\nMove into that directory:\n1cd intro-to-cs-git-review Check the status of the git repository:\n1git status You should see output something like:\n1On branch main 2Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/main\u0026#39;. 3 4nothing to commit, working tree clean If so, great! You have successfully forked and cloned this repository. If not, check in with someone in your group or one of the teachers to help before moving on to the next steps.\n2. Checkout a new branch One of the great things about Git is being able to work on the same repository as others at the same time. A typical way of doing this when working on a project is by creating and checking out a new branch (via git checkout -b \u0026lt;branch-name\u0026gt;), making changes and committing your work, and pushing this work to your separate branch. Once you are ready to publish your changes to the main branch, you can create a pull request (PR) to have others review your changes and merge them to the main branch.\nEven though you are working on your own repository alone (since you forked, this is your own repository), let's practice creating a new branch so we can make some changes there and eventually merge this back to the main branch. Let's call this branch \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch (leave out the \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, for example, for me, I would call the branch eelanagaraj/test-branch):\n1git checkout -b \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch Check the status of the repository again before moving on to the next step, and make sure that you are on the correct branch. (Hint: run git status which displays the branch you are on, and make sure this is what you expect.)\n3. Making and committing some changes This activity should remind you a bit of the directory \u0026quot;maze\u0026quot; exploration activity that we did with Erg√ºn last week.\nLet's go ahead and explore the contents of this repository. For these tasks, feel free to look at your notes, the cheat sheet above, or ask each other for help if you're not sure how to complete a task :)\n  Print your current directory, to double check that you are in the right place :) The end of the path should be the name of the cloned repository.\n  Check what files and directories are present in this repository.\n  Print the contents of the README.md file. Now, compare the output in your terminal to the README displayed on the original remote repository. (Note: the README.md file will be displayed by default on your remote repository page!)\n  Move into the some-files directory. What files are in this repository?\n  Check the contents of each of the files in this folder (some-files). Delete the file that is empty (has no contents).\n  Check the status of the repository via git status. If you do not see something that says you deleted a file, please ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on.\n  Stage the changes by running git add . and check the status again to make sure the changes have shown up in your staging area.\n  Create a commit now to \u0026quot;save\u0026quot; your changes--in this case, the deleted file. Try to leave a helpful commit message like below, replacing  with the file you deleted:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Deleted file \u0026lt;name-of-file\u0026gt;\u0026#34;   Check that the commit was successful by checking the status of the repository (git status) and checking the log (git log). You should see the commit message that you added at the top of the log, in addition to some previous commits from before you cloned the repository.\n  One of the non-empty files has the contents: Hello, I'm a file! What's your name?. Modify this file that answers the question with your name (or one of your choosing)! So far, we have used: echo \u0026quot;text\u0026quot; \u0026gt; file to add content to a file, but this will overwrite the file with the new contents. Instead, let's append to the file using the following command (replacing \u0026lt;file.txt\u0026gt; with the file you want to write to):\n1echo \u0026#34;My name is ___\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file.txt\u0026gt; You can also open this file in a text editor (like Sublime, Microsoft Word, Notepad, etc.) and modify it there and save your changes!\n  Check the git status again. Can you tell that a file has been modified? If not, ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on. If so, in the same way as above, add these changes to your staging area and create another commit with a descriptive message of your choice. Check that this commit appears in the log as well.\n  Let's go ahead and push these commits so far to the remote repository. Run the following, replacing \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; with the branch you are working on (if you forget what it is called, you can run git status or git branch and copy the branch name from there!):\n  1git push origin \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt;  Navigate out of the some-files directory, so you are back in the root of the repository. Display the contents of the files there. One of the files seems to be out of place; move this file to the some-files directory. Check that this file is now in the proper place by listing the contents of the directory some-files. Check the status of the repository again (git status). Notice that it thinks the file was deleted from the repository, but that there is now a new \u0026quot;untracked file\u0026quot; of the same name in some-files! Let's now add all of the files to the staging area and check the status of the repository again. What does it look like now? Let's commit these staged changes and check the log again to make sure they appeared. In the root of the repository, go ahead and delete the delete-me directory. (Hint: what option do you need to include to remove a directory?). Add, commit, and push these changes.  4. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub As we did at the end of last class, let's create a pull request to merge this test-branch to main.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch: on the left side, there should be a button with main and a down arrow -- click this and select your branch. At the top, if there is an option to \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot;, click that, otherwise click on the \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot; tab and then \u0026quot;New pull request\u0026quot;.\nSince this is a forked branch, we are given the option of submitting a pull request against the original repository that we forked from (listed under base repository). This is often how you can contribute to open source projects -- by forking the repository, making your changes, and then submitting a PR against the original repo for the maintainers of the project to accept or reject.\nFor now, let's just PR within the fork, so change the base repository to be the forked repo. (The base repository and head repository should match, but the base branch should be main).\nAssign someone in your group and one of the teachers to review your pull request.\nTake a moment to review any PRs you were tagged on.\n5. [Optional] Advanced Git practice This is a section for if you are done with the earlier sections and want to try some new git commands out. This is completely optional and more complicated than the previous sections! Remember, you can play around with this repo as much as you want; use it to create new scenarios and test out Git commands to understand what they do. This is a toy repository, and you can always clone a fresh copy (first part of the activity) to restart from scratch, so there is low risk here :)\nFirst, we can use the git reset command to undo changes that we have made.\n Check that you are still on \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/test-branch. Then, checkout a new branch \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/undo-changes, replacing \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt; with your GitHub username. Look at the git log, which should include all of the commits we made in the previous section. Let's say that we now want to \u0026quot;undo\u0026quot; the changes that we made in the last commit, deleting the delete-me folder. We realized after pushing this change that we actually want to keep this folder. Find and copy the commit hash (looks like a long string of letters and numbers, something like: 6ff15394c57d1d105482efd9359d7a061995fedc) of the commit right before this in the commit log. Let's now \u0026quot;reset\u0026quot; the state of the repository to this commit, right before we committed the change to delete the directory, replacing \u0026lt;commit-hash\u0026gt; with the hash from your commit log:  1git reset --hard \u0026lt;commit-hash\u0026gt;  Check the git status of your directory and the git log now. What is the most recent commit in the commit log now? Check the contents of the repository. Is the delete-me folder present or not? Check the contents of the delete-me folder. Feel free to try resetting the repository to different states (different commit hashes) and exploring a bit. Once you are done, you can checkout (get back onto) the main or test-branch from the earlier section and deleting the branch you just created:  1git checkout main 2git branch -D \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/undo-changes If you still have time and want to continue playing around with Git, try to merge two branches that have made changes on the same file. You can see how Git tries to do this automatically and you may have to \u0026quot;resolve merge conflicts\u0026quot; if Git is not able to automatically merge the changes. To create a situation like this:\n Create two branches from the same \u0026quot;base\u0026quot; and checkout one of them. Remember, replace \u0026lt;new-branch-1\u0026gt; nd \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt; with branch names of your choice. (Bonus: look up how to do this via the git branch command instead of git checkout -b): 1git checkout -b \u0026lt;new-branch-1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base-branch\u0026gt; 2git checkout -b \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base-branch\u0026gt;  Modify and commit to a.txt on  Make a different change to the same file, a.txt on  Try to merge one branch into the other by checkout out  and then running git merge \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt;. Did you get any merge conflicts? See what the contents of file a.txt are. Try to fix any merge conflicts and commit this merge. Check the log to see what the merge commit looks like.

(If you don't already have a designated folder for class materials, create a directory for this and navigate into it.) Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of another repository, usually one that is stored on a remote server like GitHub.\nFork this repository. In the top right corner, click Fork. You may be prompted with a question like \u0026quot;Where should we fork this repository to?\u0026quot; If so, click your GitHub username; this will create a copy of the repository to your account.\nYou should then be automatically taken to the main page of this repository.\nOn the upper right side, click Code (in green) and copy the HTTPS link. Then in your terminal run git clone \u0026lt;link-you-copied\u0026gt;. For example, this should look something like the following (with github-username replaced with your own github username):\n1git clone https://github.com/ReDI-School/spring-2021-intro-to-programming-md-journal Check that this directory now exists. (Hint: list the contents of the directory you are in, and make sure you see the cloned folder.)\nMove into that directory (small hint -\u0026gt; write cd spring and then press the key TAB and it will autocomplete):\n1cd spring-2021-intro-to-programming-md-journal Check the status of the git repository:\n1git status You should see output something like:\n1On branch main 2Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/main\u0026#39;. 3 4nothing to commit, working tree clean If so, great! You have successfully forked and cloned this repository. If not, check in with someone in your group or raise your hand so one of the teachers to help before moving on to the next steps.\n2. Checkout a new branch One of the great things about Git is being able to work on the same repository as others at the same time. A typical way of doing this when working on a project is by creating and checking out a new branch (via git checkout -b \u0026lt;branch-name\u0026gt;), making changes and committing your work, and pushing this work to your separate branch.

(Hint: run git status which displays the branch you are on, and make sure this is what you expect.)\n3. Open with VSCode the folder you have just created Open VScode! :D once you are there let's click on file in the top left corner and click on Open.... Look for the the folder in your system you have just created (probably should be around /home) and click it.\nYour VSCode should show now on the left side the differents files and folders from the current scenario.\n4. Complete the tasks in the README.md file from the repository you have just created. In the README.md file from the repo you have just copied there is a section called ## TASKS. Go slowly one by one and complete them by marking them with a X\n5. Adding and committing some changes Once completed! let's make the world know about our recipes. This activity should remind you a bit of the directory \u0026quot;maze\u0026quot; exploration activity that we did with Erg√ºn last week.\n  Check the status of the repository via git status. If you do not see something that says you deleted a file, please ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on.\n  Stage the changes by running git add . or git add --all and check the status again to make sure the changes have shown up in your staging area. They should be green\n  Create a commit now to \u0026quot;save\u0026quot; your changes--in this case, the deleted file. Try to leave a helpful commit message like below, replacing  with the file you deleted:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Created my first journal!\u0026#34;   Check that the commit was successful by checking the status of the repository (git status) and checking the log (git log). You should see the commit message that you added at the top of the log, in addition to some previous commits from before you cloned the repository.\n  Let's go ahead and push these commits so far to the remote repository. Run the following, replacing \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; with the branch you are working on (if you forget what it is called, you can run git status or git branch and copy the branch name from there!):\n  1git push origin \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; 6. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub As we did at the end of last class, let's create a pull request to merge this test-branch to main.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch: on the left side, there should be a button with main and a down arrow -- click this and select your branch. At the top, if there is an option to \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot;, click that, otherwise click on the \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot; tab and then \u0026quot;New pull request\u0026quot;.\nSince this is a forked branch, we are given the option of submitting a pull request against the original repository that we forked from (listed under base repository). This is often how you can contribute to open source projects -- by forking the repository, making your changes, and then submitting a PR against the original repo for the maintainers of the project to accept or reject.\nFor now, let's just PR within the fork, so change the base repository to be the forked repo. (The base repository and head repository should match, but the base branch should be main).\nAssign someone in your group to the PR 'it can be seen in the right section and approve and merge the changes into main.\n7. (Optional) Let¬¥s swap places Now it is time for your partner to repeat what you have done.\nBUT! instead of forking the repository we will clone directly your partner repository so both of you can contribute towards a shared journal.\nFor that let¬¥s do the following:\n Ask your partner for an URL pointing to his journal repository that both of you have created and existts in Github. Let¬¥s clone the repository (make sure the Pull Request opened is merged and that the main branch has the content you just created) Add some new files, folders, images and after add, commit and push your changes. You can go back to section 3 and repeat the same instructions  Extra resources  Git online VSCode Crash course   VSCODE CHEATSHEET Install an extension Installing an extension\nCreating a new folder To create a folder we first need to click on the left sidebar the explorer icon.

HTML, HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a Web Browser.\nWeb brosers fetch HTML documents from Web servers over the internet or on your laptop\nStructure of HTML Documents HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages and specify how text, images, video and interactive forms can be embedded on a web page which is being displayed in the browser.\nHTML elements are specified using tags that are within angle brackets \u0026lt;\u0026gt; for example the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag. Tags usually come in pairs of start and end tags. For example \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;. Usually when speaking about HTML tags, we simply ignore whether it is a start or end tag and simply use the tag name.\nThe set of all start and end tags in a HTML document form a hierarchy (just like a family tree). For example in the HTML markup below, the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag is the parent of the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags. The \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; tag is a child of the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag and a grandchild of the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag.\n1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;This is a title\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello world!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 9 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 11\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Important HTML Tags    Tag Purpose Playground     \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Creates an HTML document    \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; Contains the title of the document \u0026amp; other info that isn't displayed Try it   \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; Contains the visible parts of the document    \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Specifies the name of the document in the browser title bar; when bookmarking pages, this is what is bookmarked    \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Creates text headlines.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.\nCSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.\nCSS Rule A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:\n1/* The selector \u0026#34;p\u0026#34; indicates that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */ 2p { 3 /* The \u0026#34;color\u0026#34; property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */ 4 color: yellow; 5 6 /* The \u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34; property defines the background color, in this case black. */ 7 background-color: black 8} How does CSS Actually Work When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.\n  The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).\n  It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.\n  The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.\n  The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different \u0026quot;buckets\u0026quot;, e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).\n  The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.\n  The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).\n  How CSS is structured There are typically 3 ways we do that to include CSS in a HTML Page:\n Inline CSS  1\u0026lt;h1 style=\u0026#34;color: blue\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Hello world! \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; Internal CSS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; 3 h1 { 4 color: blue; 5 } 6 \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; External CSS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;style.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; CSS Selectors  Element  The first way to select an HTML element is by simply using the name:\n1h1 { 2 font-size: 20px; 3} 4p { 5 color: green; 6} 7div { 8 margin: 10px; 9} We are selecting different elements like h1, p, div and giving them different style attributes. The font-size controls the size of the text, color sets the text color, and margin adds spacing around the element.\nClass  Another way of selecting HTML elements is by using the class attribute. In HTML, we can assign different classes to our elements. Each element can have multiple classes, and each class can also be applied to multiple elements as well.\n1\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#39;container\u0026#39;\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; This is heading \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 4 5 6.container { 7 background-color: blue; 8} In the code above, we have assigned the class of container to the div element. In the stylesheet, we select our class using .className format and giving it a blue background color.\nID  Like classes, we can also use IDs to select HTML elements and apply styling to them. The only difference between class and ID is that one ID can be assigned to only one HTML element in one page.\n1\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;p id=\u0026#39;para1\u0026#39;\u0026gt; This is a paragraph \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 4 5 6#para1 { 7 color: green; 8 font-size: 16px; 9} Extra resources  Learn to style HTML using CSS Build a Classic Layout FAST in CSS Grid Inspecting the CSS Cascade using Firefox DevTools Flexbox Froggy Grid Garden CSS Diner  Next class preparation Practical lesson demonstrating HTML \u0026amp; CSS ","link":"https://redi-school.github.io/ber-dcp-intro-to-computer-science/docs/web/basic_css/","title":"30/March - Basic knowledge of CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)"},{"body":"Welcome to Intro to Computer-Science 2021 course Berlin üá©üá™ Here you will find most of the content for our courses, prerequisites for each class, summaries of the classes and extra content so you can work on your own.\nThis is a work in process document for the course of 2021 in Berlin.
