HTML, HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a Web Browser.\nWeb brosers fetch HTML documents from Web servers over the internet or on your laptop\nStructure of HTML Documents HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages and specify how text, images, video and interactive forms can be embedded on a web page which is being displayed in the browser.\nHTML elements are specified using tags that are within angle brackets \u0026lt;\u0026gt; for example the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag. Tags usually come in pairs of start and end tags. For example \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;. Usually when speaking about HTML tags, we simply ignore whether it is a start or end tag and simply use the tag name.\nThe set of all start and end tags in a HTML document form a hierarchy (just like a family tree). For example in the HTML markup below, the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag is the parent of the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags. The \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; tag is a child of the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag and a grandchild of the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag.\n1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;This is a title\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello world!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 9 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 11\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Important HTML Tags    Tag Purpose Playground     \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Creates an HTML document    \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; Contains the title of the document \u0026amp; other info that isn't displayed Try it   \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; Contains the visible parts of the document    \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Specifies the name of the document in the browser title bar; when bookmarking pages, this is what is bookmarked    \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Creates text headlines.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.\nCSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.\nCSS Rule A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:\n1/* The selector \u0026#34;p\u0026#34; indicates that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */ 2p { 3 /* The \u0026#34;color\u0026#34; property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */ 4 color: yellow; 5 6 /* The \u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34; property defines the background color, in this case black. */ 7 background-color: black 8} How does CSS Actually Work When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.\n  The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).\n  It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.\n  The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.\n  The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different \u0026quot;buckets\u0026quot;, e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).\n  The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.\n  The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).\n  How CSS is structured There are typically 3 ways we do that to include CSS in a HTML Page:\n Inline CSS  1\u0026lt;h1 style=\u0026#34;color: blue\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Hello world! \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; Internal CSS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; 3 h1 { 4 color: blue; 5 } 6 \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; External CSS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;style.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; CSS Selectors  Element  The first way to select an HTML element is by simply using the name:\n1h1 { 2 font-size: 20px; 3} 4p { 5 color: green; 6} 7div { 8 margin: 10px; 9} We are selecting different elements like h1, p, div and giving them different style attributes. The font-size controls the size of the text, color sets the text color, and margin adds spacing around the element.\nClass  Another way of selecting HTML elements is by using the class attribute. In HTML, we can assign different classes to our elements. Each element can have multiple classes, and each class can also be applied to multiple elements as well.\n1\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#39;container\u0026#39;\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; This is heading \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 4 5 6.container { 7 background-color: blue; 8} In the code above, we have assigned the class of container to the div element. In the stylesheet, we select our class using .className format and giving it a blue background color.\nID  Like classes, we can also use IDs to select HTML elements and apply styling to them. The only difference between class and ID is that one ID can be assigned to only one HTML element in one page.\n1\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;p id=\u0026#39;para1\u0026#39;\u0026gt; This is a paragraph \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 4 5 6#para1 { 7 color: green; 8 font-size: 16px; 9} Extra resources  Learn to style HTML using CSS Build a Classic Layout FAST in CSS Grid Inspecting the CSS Cascade using Firefox DevTools Flexbox Froggy Grid Garden CSS Diner  Next class preparation Practical lesson demonstrating HTML \u0026amp; CSS ","link":"https://redi-school.github.io/ber-dcp-intro-to-computer-science/docs/web/basic_css/","title":"30/March - Basic knowledge of CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)"},{"body":"Prerequisites  Decide who to build a website for: you? your pet? someone else?

What has changed?\n2. Navigation Bar (navbar) We have an empty webpage - so much space to fill! Let's start with a navbar.\nA navbar contains a list of the places to navigate to on a website e.g. Home, Notifications, Messages.\nOur website will contain three sections: Home, About and Contact.\nContent (HTML) ✏️ Add the following in between the two \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags (replacing the comment).\n1\u0026lt;!-- Header --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;header class=\u0026#34;intro\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;!-- Navbar --\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;navbar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#about\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#contact\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; 📖 What does this mean?\n The \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; tag is used to specify that a header is added to the page. This typically contains a navigation bar and/or introductory information.  1\u0026lt;header class=\u0026#34;intro\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2... 3\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; 4 The \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag represents a new section or division. The \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag is used to link from one page to another, or if a # is used, to link to another section on the same page. Later on we will create sections for About and Contact.  1 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;navbar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#about\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#contact\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Go to your browser and refresh the page to display this content. You will see that the navbar content is present but is unstyled, so we will add some styling with CSS.\nStyling (CSS) ✏️ In your IDE open the file: assets/css/style.css.\n Add the following to style and set a the colour of the navbar:  1body { 2 margin: 0px; 3} 4 5.navbar { 6 background-color: #5354f4; 7 overflow: hidden; 8} 🎨 The text #5354f4 represents a hex colour code. Use a colour picker to choose a different colour and change this!\nNext, style the navigation bar links by adding the following to style.css:  1/*Navigation bar links*/ 2.navbar a { 3 display: block; 4 padding: 20px 25px; 5 text-align: center; 6 text-decoration: none; 7 float: left; 8 color: white; 9} 🎨 For each of these items, see if you can figure out what it does either by making a search on Ecosia or by editing/removing them.\nLastly change what happens when a mouse is hovering over a link, by adding the following:  1/*Hovering over navigation bar*/ 2.navbar a:hover { 3 background-color: #faf800; 4 color: black; 5} 🎨 Again, change each of these to understand what they are doing.\n3. Adding an introduction header Within the header, we want to introduce ourselves and say hello to the world. We will add a greeting here.\nContent (HTML) ✏️ Return to the index.html file and add the following content after the navbar section and still between the \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; tags:\n1 \u0026lt;!-- Introduction --\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h1 class=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Hello, my name is ___ \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;h3 class=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;My title\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; The \u0026lt;h\u0026gt; tags are used to create different headings and subheadings. Here \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is used as the main heading, and \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt; as a subheading.\n🎨 Now customise the greeting and title with your name and title e.g. your title could be Redi School Student, Programmer or even an emoji like: 💻.\nStyling (CSS) ✏️ Open style.css again.\nWe will change the font and position the intro text in the centre of the screen. Then we will add a background image.\n Change the font  Where you have previously, added:\nbody { margin: 0px; } Replace this with the following:\n1body, 2html { 3 height: 100%; 4 margin: 0px; 5} 6body, 7h1, 8h2, 9h3, 10h4, 11h5, 12h6, 13p { 14 font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 15 font-weight: 500; 16 color: #5354f4; 17} This will:\n make the body have 100% of the screen height. change the font for all text types to Arial, and change the text colour and weight.  🎨 Again, customise the following:\n font font-weight colour  Now we will center the text in the screen  ✏️ Add the following to the CSS file:\n1/*Introduction*/ 2.summary { 3 position: absolute; 4 top: 50%; 5 left: 50%; 6 transform: translate(-50%,-50%); 7 8 text-align: center; 9 letter-spacing: 4px; 10} Read through each of these items. Can you figure out what each of them is doing? Try searching Ecosia, asking one of the instructors or experimenting by changing them.\nLastly, we will add a background image  For this, we will need the image that you selected as part of your preparation work.\nSave this image to the folder: assets/images and give it the name background.jpg (or if it is an png image, background.png)\n✏️ Now add the following to style.css:\n1.intro { 2 height: 100%; 3 background-image: url(\u0026#34;../images/background.png\u0026#34;); 4 background-size: cover; 5} If your background image has a .jpg extension, change this to url(\u0026quot;../images/background.jpg\u0026quot;);.\n4. About section ✏️ Next we will add an about section. Between the \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; tag and \u0026lt;/body tag, add the following:\nContent (HTML) 1\u0026lt;!-- About --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;about\u0026#34; id=about\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;About Me\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some things I like are ___ . I am learning about ____. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 5\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 🎨 Customise the text between the \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; paragraph tags.\nStyling (CSS) ✏️ To style the text in the About section, add the following:\n1/*about section*/ 2 3.about h2, p { 4 text-align: left; 5 padding-left: 25%; 6 padding-top: 1%; 7 padding-bottom: 1%; 8 9} 10 11.about p { 12 font-size: 20px; 13} This will align the text and change the font size of the paragraph.\n🎨 Change the font size and padding.\n5. Contact section Finally, we will add a Contact section with a list of links for how to contact us.\nContent (HTML) ✏️ Add the following underneath the About section:\n1\u0026lt;!-- Contact --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;div class = \u0026#34;contact\u0026#34; id=contact\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://github.com/\u0026lt;exampleuser\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;GitHub\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;mailto:example@email.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Email\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/\u0026lt;exampleuser\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Twitter\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; This creates a Contact section with an unordered list (\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;). Each list item \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; is a link to different forms of contact.\n🎨 Customise this list by adding/removing/editting the contents, but don't add any contact details that you are not comfortable with.\nStyling (CSS) We will style the Contact section similiarly to the About section. The main difference is that this time we have a list and we want to style the list and its items.\n✏️ Add the following to the style.css document.\n1.contact h2, ul, li { 2 text-align: left; 3 padding-left: 25%; 4 padding-top: 1%; 5 padding-bottom: 1%; 6} 7 8.contact li { 9 padding-left: 1%; 10} 11 12.contact a { 13 border-bottom: dotted; 14 text-decoration: none; 15} 🎨 Learn what each of these is doing by customising the section, looking up what they mean or removing them entirely!\n6. Follow-up Here are some things you can do to continue your work:\n Compile a list of questions: what didn't you understand? Share the questions in the team slack. Remember if you are unsure about something, then someone else probably is too. Sharing questions openly helps everyone learn, including the teachers and instructors. Further customise the website by adding or removing sections, for example adding a section for photos or fun facts. Commit your changes and push your code to GitHub.

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.) It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.\n JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. JavaScript can both be used as a client-side and server-side programming language JavaScript is an untyped programming language   1\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Player 1: Chris\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 1p { 2 font-family: \u0026#39;helvetica neue\u0026#39;, helvetica, sans-serif; 3 text-align: center; 4 border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6); 5 color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6); 6 display: inline-block; 7 cursor: pointer; 8} 1const para = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;); 2 3para.addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, updateName); 4 5function updateName() { 6 let name = prompt(\u0026#39;Enter a new name\u0026#39;); 7 para.textContent = \u0026#39;Player 1: \u0026#39; + name; 8}   What can JavaScript do The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:\n  Store useful values inside variables.\n  Operate on text pieces to form new text pieces\n  Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.\n  Dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a web page ( with the DOM API)\n  Retrieves geographical information ( with the Geolocation API )\n  Create animated 2D and 3D graphics (with the Canvas and WebGL APIs)\n  Play audio and video right in a web page, create audio and video calls ( with the Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC)\n  And much,much more!\n  How do you add JavaScript to your page There are typically 3 ways we do that to include JS in a HTML Page ( just like CSS):\n Inline JS  1\u0026lt;button onclick=\u0026#34;javascript:alert(\u0026#39;You clicked me!\u0026#39;)\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; Internal JS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; 3 let counter = 1; 4 counter++; 5 alert(\u0026#34;Counter is now:\u0026#34;, counter); 6 \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; External JS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;script.js\u0026#34; defer\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;script-independent.js\u0026#34; async\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 4\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; Ways of loading JS scripts  If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use async. If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using defer and put their corresponding \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.  Basic JS Guide  Comments:  1/* 2Comments are important because they help other people understand 3what is going on in your code. 4This is a multi line comment 5*/ 6 7// This is a single line comment Variables:  Stand-in values that you can use to perform operations.\n1 2// The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables 3// defined with var move to the top when the code is executed. 4var name = \u0026#34;JavaScript\u0026#34; 5// Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code. 6const PI = 3.14 7// Similar to const, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared. 8let lastName = \u0026#34;Language\u0026#34; Data Types  Variables can contain different types of values and data types. You use = to assign them:\n1let age = 23 // Numbers 2let x // variables 3let a = \u0026#34;init\u0026#34; // text - strings 4let b = 1 + 2 + 3 // operations 5let c = true // true or false, booelans 6const PI = 3.14 // constants 7let person = {firstName:\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, lastName:\u0026#34;Doe\u0026#34;} //objects 8let numbers = [1, 2, 3] // arrays - contain 3 items Operators  If you have variables, you can use them to perform different kinds of operations. To do so, you need operators. Basic\n1+ — //Addition 2- — //Subtraction 3* — Multiplication 4/ — Division 5(...) — Grouping operator, operations within brackets are executed earlier than those outside 6% — Modulus (remainder ) 7++ — Increment numbers 8-- — Decrement numbers  Comparison\n== — Equal to === — Equal value and equal type != — Not equal !== — Not equal value or not equal type \u0026gt; — Greater than \u0026lt; — Less than \u0026gt;= — Greater than or equal to \u0026lt;= — Less than or equal to ? — Ternary operator  Logical\n\u0026amp;\u0026amp; — Logical and || — Logical or ! — Logical not   Functions  JavaScript functions are blocks of code that perform a certain task. A basic function looks like this:\n1function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) { 2 console.log(parameter1); 3} Extra resources  📽️ Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners - Continue watching 📚 Learn JS 📚 JavaScript for impatient programmers  Next class preparation Practical lesson JS ","link":"https://redi-school.github.io/ber-dcp-intro-to-computer-science/docs/web/basic_js/","title":"06/April - Basic knowledge of Javascript"},{"body":"Preparations  Class Curriculum    Section content Expected time (mins) Pre - Requirements     Intro to Lesson 5 minutes ❌   Practical Activity (in smaller groups) 40-50 minutes VsCode and Git installed   Checkout 5 minutes ❌    Lesson Goal Practice what we've learned so far!\nWe're going to make use of the command line, HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a web page that displays the time and date!\n1. Set up a new repository  Open the terminal. Create a new directory and move to the new directory:  mkdir date-time-website \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd date-time-website  Create a README:  echo \u0026quot;# Time and Date Website\u0026quot; \u0026gt; README.md  Initialise a new repository and change the branch to main:  git init git checkout -b main  Create the first commit:  git a . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initialise the repository with a README\u0026quot; 2. Create the HTML files  Open VSCode from the terminal:  code .   Create a file called index.html\n  Add the following to index.html:\n  1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; Date and Time Website \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 8 9\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Today\u0026#39;s date is Tuesday, 13th April \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 11 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; The time is 20:30 CET \u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 12\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 13 14\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; This sets up the content of the webpage. But there is a problem! We have hard-coded the date and time. To hard-code something means to set it so that it cannot be changed or updated. The webpage will always say it is Tuesday, 13th of April, even when it is not. In Section 3 we will use Javascript to display the correct date and time always.\n  Run LiveServer\n  Add and commit this to git.\n[hint: git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, replacing ... with a meningful message.]\n  3. Create the CSS Files   Create a file called style.css.\n  Add the following to style.css to style the page:\n  1body { 2 text-align: center; 3 background-color: teal; 4 font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 5 font-weight: 500; 6 color: silver; 7}  In index.html, append the following between the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tags to reference the css file:  1 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;style.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt;   Refresh LiveServer\n  Change the colours and font weight.\n  Add and commit your changes to git.\n[hint: git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, replacing ... with a meaningful message.]\n  4. Introduce Javascript to find the date and time   Create a file called script.js\n  Add the following to the script:\n  1var date = new Date(); 2 3// We can take a look at what d contains with the console: 4console.log(date) 5 6// Extract the date from d: 7var currentDate = date.toDateString() 8 9// Extract the time from d: 10var currentTime = date.toLocaleTimeString() 11 12document.body.innerHTML = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Today\u0026#39;s date is \u0026#34; + currentDate + \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; The time is \u0026#34; + currentTime + \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Here we use the Javascript Date object to retrieve the date and time and assign it to a variable, d. We then make use of two methods toDateString() and toLocalTimeString() to extract only the information that we want (the date and time) from the variable, d and assign this information to two new variables, currentDate and currentTime. The document.body.innerHTML. If this is your first time encountering the term variable, one of the teachers can explain what the term means.\n Replace the following in index.html:  1\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Today\u0026#39;s date is Tuesday, 13th April \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; The time is 20:30 CET \u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; with :\n1 2\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;./script.js\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 4\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;   Refresh LiveServer\n  Use your browser's Developer Tools to inspect the page, and take a look at what was logged in the Javascript you wrote (console.log(date))\n  Add and commit these changes to git.\n[hint: git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, replacing ... with a meaningful message.]\n  5. Push to Github   Create a repository on GitHub, called date-time-website\n  Connect the GitHub repository to your local repository:\n[Hint: git remote add origin https://...]\n  Push your work to Github\n  Learning more HTML, CSS or Javascript To learn more about HTML, CSS and/or Javascript:\n  Learn creative coding with p5js.

Install Git 💾 First! Check if you already have git installed, open your command line and run:\n1git --version If you see something like the following output then you already have git installed:\n1git version 2.x.x Otherwise, here are instructions to install Git:\n For Windows For MacOS  2. Sign up to GitHub 🚀 Sign up here: https://github.com/join\nWhy?\n We will use it in the class to store our code It can be used to collaborate with others It can be used to showcase your work  3. Watch the first 8:07 minutes of this video 📽️ This Git and GitHub Tutorial For Beginners by Amigoscode.\nWhat you will learn:\n An overview of why Git and Github are so useful  You can watch the rest if you want, but for the purpose of the class, the first eight minutes are sufficient.\n4. Read this 📚 Read this Introduction to Version Control and Git by CodeBar.\nWhat you will learn:\n What is version control? Why do we use it? Overview of Git as a version control system Overview of GitHub as a place to store code Common terminology   Class Curriculum    Section content Expected time (mins) Pre - Requirements     Review Learnings from Preparatory Materials 15 minutes video + article   Lesson Goals 5-10 minutes ❌   Make a local repository and first commits 10-15 minutes git   Create a GitHub repository and push commits 10-15 minutes git and github   Class break 10 minutes ❌   Make a branch and open a pull request 15-20 minutes git and github   Fork and clone a GitHub repository 10-15 minutes git and github   Wrap-up and next class overview 10-15 minutes ❌    Lesson Goal Use Git and GitHub to make a profile README for your GitHub account.\n1. Create a local repository First, create a new directory and give it the same name as your GitHub username (the reason for this will become clear later):\n1mkdir \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Move into that directory\n1cd \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Initialise an empty git repository with the branch name, main:\n1git init -b main Now you have an empty local repository 🎉\n2. Make a commit Next, we want to make changes within this repository and save (or commit!) them.\nA commit is a way to save changes you’ve made to a repository. It is powerful because it allows you to keep snapshots of your repository at any given time.\nFirst, we create a new file:\n1touch README.md This is a README file using markdown syntax.\nNext, we will add some text to this file to say hello to the world.\n1echo \u0026#34;# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; :)\u0026#34; \u0026gt; README.md Then view the status of the current git repository:\n1git status The README.md file will appear in the untracked files. We want to track this file and add it to the staging area so it will be included in the next commit:\n1git add . Then check the status again.\nLet's commit this file with a helpful commit message:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Initialise repository with a README\u0026#34; Finally, we can take a look at the log, to view metadata about our previous commits:\n1git log 3. Create a remote repository (on GitHub) Sign in to GitHub: https://github.com\nOn the top navigation bar, click the + button and select ‘New repository’\nCreate a new repository: Give the repository the same name as your username, make sure it is ‘Public’ then click ‘Create repository’.\n4. Push the contents of your local repository to the remote Now we want to associate our local repository with the one we have created on GitHub and push the contents of our local repository to GitHub.\nConnect the local repository with the remote repository:\n1git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git Verify that the remote was added:\n1git remote -v You should see the following output:\n1origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (fetch) 2origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (push) Finally push your changes to GitHub:\n1git push -u origin main Check your GitHub repository to see if it contains your README file, and look at your profile to see that it is displayed!\nWell done on sharing your first repository 🎉\n5. Create a branch Now we want to make some changes to our README, but we don't want to commit them to the main branch yet. Therefore, we will use another branch.\nCreate a new branch, called ‘add-more-detail’:\n1git checkout -b add-more-detail Open the README.md file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad or TextEdit) and make some changes. Here is a template you can use:\n1# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; 👋 2 3Pronouns: \u0026lt;your pronouns\u0026gt; 4Learning: command line, Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python 5Interests: \u0026lt;your interests\u0026gt; You can be as creative as you want by adding text, emoji, images or gifs (and more!).\nOnce you have made some changes it is time to add and commit them:\n1git add . 2git commit -m \u0026#34;Add some new information\u0026#34; Then push the branch with the changes to the remote repository:\n1git push origin add-more-detail Take a look at your README profile - has it been updated?\n6. Create a pull request Let's say we want to get feedback on the changes we've made. We can do this with a Pull Request.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch. Select 'Create new pull request'.\nAssign the person you are paired with to review your pull request.\nReviewing a pull request If somebody has requested your feedback, you can use this as an opportunity to:\n Ask questions and provide feedback about the changes Approve the changes Request further changes  Once you have reviewed the changes, click Review changes and then Approve.\nMerge a pull request Once your pull request has been reviewed, you can merge it so that the main branch is updated with your changes.\nOn your pull request, go to the bottom of the page and select Rebase and merge.\nYou can now go to your command line, checkout the main branch and pull the changes so that your local main branch is up to date:\n1git checkout main 2git pull origin main Finally, take a look at your updated GitHub profile README and celebrate what you've achieved!\n7. Fork and clone a repository Note 📝\nThis task is unrelated to the previous tasks, but has been included because these features are useful.\nA fork is a copy of someone else’s remote repository, sometimes you will make a fork to build on someone else's work.\nNavigate to https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife\nOn the top-right, select 'Fork'.\nOnce you have forked the repository, we can clone it to download a copy of the repository to your local machine. On the repository, select Code and copy the HTTPS link. Then navigate to your terminal and run:\n1git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git 8.

Python Overview Q\u0026amp;A Intro   What is Python?\nPython is a high-level programming language\n  What is a high-level programming language?\n \u0026quot;program\u0026quot;: writing instructions for your computer to execute; this could be a simple \u0026quot;calculator\u0026quot; program that adds two numbers, it could be something that prints out values to your terminal or sends information to a remote server/web-page, etc. \u0026quot;programming language\u0026quot;: the language (set of words used according to specific syntax rules) that lets you write a program that can be executed on a machine \u0026quot;high-level\u0026quot;: there are different ways of interacting with the computer; at the lowest level, this is the binary code that computers can read and execute. Above that are different levels of closeness to machine-readable code: directly above is machine or assembly code that is slightly more readable but also compiles into this binary code for computers. There are more levels above this, and at the highest level (like Python), code words in human-readable languages (like English) represent large series of simple assembly steps. You can write some complex set of loops, etc. and the \u0026quot;Python interpreter\u0026quot; \u0026quot;interprets\u0026quot; these instructions in Python, turning them into something that the machine can comprehend. You don't have to worry about managing how your computer stores memory (more on this later), since Python takes care of this.    What are terms that you may hear when discussing programs and programming languages?\n \u0026quot;abstraction\u0026quot;: something that has usually \u0026quot;hidden away\u0026quot; the inner complexities of a system; usually simplifies how we understand something. \u0026quot;under the hood\u0026quot;: the details of how something works when you look past the \u0026quot;layers of abstraction\u0026quot; (see above); digging into the numerous, smaller steps of how a program, application, etc. actually functions \u0026quot;black box\u0026quot;: a system whose inner-workings you do not understand; all you can see are the inputs and outputs. [ inputs -\u0026gt; BLACK_BOX -\u0026gt; outputs ]    How and in what fields is Python typically used?\n Data science: Python has many libraries (including pandas) that are useful for doing data analysis or statistics. Can be very efficient in how fast it computes data, and is for many people easier to read compared with other programming languages. Machine Learning, Deep Learning: Python notebooks and libraries (including TensorFlow and keras) make it easy and clear to create neural networks and train machine learning models for prediction and generation tasks. Running systems and infrastructure: SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) often use python as a scripting language to quickly examine, configure, and maintain infrastructure systems. Compared with other languages, it takes little code/time to write and execute a function in Python.    What examples of things you can do with Python?\n Write programs of all kinds! Write a backend server for your web application, to process (receive, send) HTTP requests Use pandas to analyze a data set Create and train a neural network or other machine learning/deep learning model ???    What questions do you have so far?\n  1. Hands-on Python Activity Go through this Exercise at your own pace in your groups. Make sure you are all doing this together and asking questions.\nThere is no rush -- it is completely fine not to finish the whole exercise!!\nThe purpose here is to start getting familiar with Python syntax through trial-and-error (so getting things wrong is completely expected and part of this process!). After this section, we will go through the activity as a group and discuss our observations of rules and concepts from Python that we took from the exercise.\nWhen you get an answer wrong, make sure you look at the correct answer below and try to understand what the expression means from the correct answer.\nRefresher of some math operators that you will see:\n +: addition -: subtraction *: multiplication a \u0026lt; b: less than --\u0026gt; \u0026quot;a is less than b\u0026quot; a \u0026gt; b: greater than --\u0026gt; \u0026quot;a is greater than b\u0026quot;  2. Python Concepts - Sharing \u0026amp; Synthesizing We will go over many of these concepts in more detail in the coming weeks, so no problem if it takes a little time for them to make sense!\nOne note about the code snippets below: in Python, we can write comments by using the # symbol; anything after this symbol is not interpreted as code or executed. This can be a really convenient way to write notes to yourselves (or future developers!) when trying to understand code you wrote.\n What observations did you have from the exercise?  Data Types   What is a data type?\n  What are examples of different data types that you saw?\n strings (ex: 'asdf', 'hello my name is x', 'a', '123') integers (ex: 1, -100, 1383234) floats (floating point values) (ex: 1.0, -100.1234, 0.0000003, 1e5) booleans (ex: True, False) lists (ex: [3, 1, 'r', 'e'], [], [3.2, 3, 4.5]) functions (ex: def my_function (a, b): ...)  (more data types that weren't shown in this exercise will be discussed in later sessions)\n  Variables   What is a variable? What's an example?\nSome word (starting with a letter, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscore _) that represents some value. We set the value of a variable with =, for example: test_var = 10 sets the variable test_var to be equal to the value of 10. Setting the value of a variable is often called assigning a variable.\n  Iterables (lists, strings, ...)   What does the len keyword do? i.e. len('asdf') or len([1,2,3,4])\nlen gets the length of any \u0026quot;iterable\u0026quot; -- any \u0026quot;thing\u0026quot; that is made up of other things that you can \u0026quot;iterate\u0026quot; or count through: list, string, tuple, dictionary, set...\n  What does the [#] syntax do?\nThis indexes into an iterable and gets you the # value of it. Note that the \u0026quot;first\u0026quot; index is \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, because we 0-index in Python. For example:\n1 a = \u0026#39;asdf\u0026#39; 2 b = [1,2,3,4] 3 a[0] 4 # outputs: -\u0026gt; \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; 5 b[3] 6 # outputs: -\u0026gt; 4   Booleans and conditions   What does the == symbol mean? What about !=?\n== is \u0026quot;equals\u0026quot;, != is \u0026quot;does not equal\u0026quot;.\n  What is the difference between = and ==?\n= is for assigning some value to a variable, while == is for testing for equality between the two sides.\n  What does the if keyword do?\nThis is a conditional statement: if CONDITION: means: \u0026quot;if CONDITION evaluates to True, then execute the code that follows directly after the statement\u0026quot;\n  How about an if ... else statement?\n1if CONDITION_A: 2 STATEMENT_A 3else: 4 STATEMENT_B In this example, \u0026quot;if CONDITION_A evaluates to True, then execute STATEMENT_A. Otherwise (if CONDITION_A evaluates to False), then execute STATEMENT_B. --\u0026gt;\n  How about if ... elif ... else?\n1if CONDITION_A: 2 STATEMENT_A 3elif: CONDITION_B: 4 STATEMENT_B 5else: 6 STATEMENT_C In this example, \u0026quot;if CONDITION_A evaluates to True, then execute STATEMENT_A only. Otherwise (if CONDITION_A evaluates to False), then check if CONDITION_B evaluates to True and if so, execute STATEMENT_B only. If both CONDITION_A and CONDITION_B evaluate to False, then execute STATEMENT_C. Note that here, we are only ever execute one of the STATEMENT_'s, even if multiple conditions evaluate to True.\n  Functions   What is a function?\n1def my_test_function(a): 2 return a A function is a sequence of steps or tasks (written in a block of code), which may or may not take in arguments. Whenever we call a function, we execute this defined set of steps (with any arguments passed in). The above example function takes in some value and simply returns, or gives us back, this value when we call it like so: my_test_function(12) # evaluates to 12\n  3. (if there is time) \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; in Python It's something of a tradition in the Computer Science world when learning a new language to write code that outputs \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;. Check out this Wikipedia article for more information on why :).\nFor today, go ahead and try that out in this Python playground, which will allow you to execute some test code by clicking on the Play button (triangle) on the top of the console window.\nExample solutions will be posted in a few days :)\nTask 0: write code that outputs \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; Tip: there is a built-in print function in Python that takes some input and outputs this to standard out (STDOUT), which is in this case the right side of the playground console. (Recall that the # stands for a \u0026quot;comment\u0026quot; in Python, meaning that this line is just a \u0026quot;note\u0026quot; to yourself and does not need to be included.)\nExample usage:\n1print(\u0026#34;asdf asdf\u0026#34;) 2# outputs -\u0026gt; asdf asdf 3print(\u0026#34;my name is\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Robot\u0026#34;) 4# outputs -\u0026gt; my name is Robot   A Solution:\n1print(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) Task 1: create and call a function that prints \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; Tip: Modify the code you wrote in the previous task so that this happens within a function that you define.  A Solution:\n1def hello_world(): 2 print(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) 3 4# Let\u0026#39;s call the function and print this 5print(hello_world()) Task 2: create a function that returns the string \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;. Call this function and print the output. A solution:\n1def hello_world(): 2 return \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; 3 4print(hello_world()) Task 3: modify your function so you can greet a specific name: \u0026quot;Hello, Person\u0026quot; In other words:\n1my_hello_world(\u0026#34;Noor\u0026#34;) 2# expected output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Noor\u0026#34; A solution:\n1def hello_world(name): 2 return (\u0026#34;Hello,\u0026#34;, name) 3 4print(hello_world(\u0026#34;Noor\u0026#34;)) 5# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Noor\u0026#34; 6print(hello_world(\u0026#34;Jose\u0026#34;)) 7# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Jose\u0026#34; Another solution:\n1def hello_world(name): 2 print(\u0026#34;Hello,\u0026#34;, name) 3 4hello_world(\u0026#34;Noor\u0026#34;) 5# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Noor\u0026#34; 6hello_world(\u0026#34;Jose\u0026#34;) 7# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Jose\u0026#34; Additional practice (all optional)  Modify your \u0026quot;greeter\u0026quot; using any of the concepts we discussed; perhaps include a conditional expression (i.e. only greet IF ...). Try to write and evaluate any Python expressions that you saw in the silent teacher activity in the playground. Write your own function to return or print some value.

Command Line cheat sheet Go through the following commands and operators to remind yourself what each of them does, and when you would use them.\nRemember that you can look up what a command does by using the man (manual-pages) command on Mac and Linux, or help command on Windows cmd. For example: man echo would give you information on what the echo command does and how to use it.     command what it does     echo print some text   pwd print working directory (print the path to where I currently am in the file system)   ls list the contents of the directory   cd change directory (this moves you, the viewer of the terminal, to a new location in the file system)   cat print the contents of the file   cp copy a file (note: to copy a directory you probably need to add an option (like -r) to copy a directory)   mv move a file or directory to a new location (note: this can also be useful for changing the name of a file/directory)   mkdir make a directory   touch create a new file   rm delete a file (note: to delete a directory, add the option -r or -d)   \u0026gt; the redirection operator (X \u0026gt; Y will send the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will overwrite the existing file.)    1. Fork and clone repository First, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. (If you don't already have a designated folder for class materials, create a directory for this and navigate into it.) Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of another repository, usually one that is stored on a remote server like GitHub.\nFork this repository. In the top right corner, click Fork. You may be prompted with a question like \u0026quot;Where should we fork this repository to?\u0026quot; If so, click your GitHub username; this will create a copy of the repository to your account.\nYou should then be automatically taken to the main page of this repository. On the upper right side, click Code (in green) and copy the HTTPS link. Then in your terminal run git clone \u0026lt;link-you-copied\u0026gt;. For example, this should look something like the following (with github-username replaced with your own github username):\n1git clone https://github.com/github-username/intro-to-cs-git-review.git Check that this directory now exists. (Hint: list the contents of the directory you are in, and make sure you see the cloned folder.)\nMove into that directory:\n1cd intro-to-cs-git-review Check the status of the git repository:\n1git status You should see output something like:\n1On branch main 2Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/main\u0026#39;. 3 4nothing to commit, working tree clean If so, great! You have successfully forked and cloned this repository. If not, check in with someone in your group or one of the teachers to help before moving on to the next steps.\n2. Checkout a new branch One of the great things about Git is being able to work on the same repository as others at the same time. A typical way of doing this when working on a project is by creating and checking out a new branch (via git checkout -b \u0026lt;branch-name\u0026gt;), making changes and committing your work, and pushing this work to your separate branch. Once you are ready to publish your changes to the main branch, you can create a pull request (PR) to have others review your changes and merge them to the main branch.\nEven though you are working on your own repository alone (since you forked, this is your own repository), let's practice creating a new branch so we can make some changes there and eventually merge this back to the main branch. Let's call this branch \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch (leave out the \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, for example, for me, I would call the branch eelanagaraj/test-branch):\n1git checkout -b \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch Check the status of the repository again before moving on to the next step, and make sure that you are on the correct branch. (Hint: run git status which displays the branch you are on, and make sure this is what you expect.)\n3. Making and committing some changes This activity should remind you a bit of the directory \u0026quot;maze\u0026quot; exploration activity that we did with Ergün last week.\nLet's go ahead and explore the contents of this repository. For these tasks, feel free to look at your notes, the cheat sheet above, or ask each other for help if you're not sure how to complete a task :)\n  Print your current directory, to double check that you are in the right place :) The end of the path should be the name of the cloned repository.\n  Check what files and directories are present in this repository.\n  Print the contents of the README.md file. Now, compare the output in your terminal to the README displayed on the original remote repository. (Note: the README.md file will be displayed by default on your remote repository page!)\n  Move into the some-files directory. What files are in this repository?\n  Check the contents of each of the files in this folder (some-files). Delete the file that is empty (has no contents).\n  Check the status of the repository via git status. If you do not see something that says you deleted a file, please ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on.\n  Stage the changes by running git add . and check the status again to make sure the changes have shown up in your staging area.\n  Create a commit now to \u0026quot;save\u0026quot; your changes--in this case, the deleted file. Try to leave a helpful commit message like below, replacing  with the file you deleted:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Deleted file \u0026lt;name-of-file\u0026gt;\u0026#34;   Check that the commit was successful by checking the status of the repository (git status) and checking the log (git log). You should see the commit message that you added at the top of the log, in addition to some previous commits from before you cloned the repository.\n  One of the non-empty files has the contents: Hello, I'm a file! What's your name?. Modify this file that answers the question with your name (or one of your choosing)! So far, we have used: echo \u0026quot;text\u0026quot; \u0026gt; file to add content to a file, but this will overwrite the file with the new contents. Instead, let's append to the file using the following command (replacing \u0026lt;file.txt\u0026gt; with the file you want to write to):\n1echo \u0026#34;My name is ___\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file.txt\u0026gt; You can also open this file in a text editor (like Sublime, Microsoft Word, Notepad, etc.) and modify it there and save your changes!\n  Check the git status again. Can you tell that a file has been modified? If not, ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on. If so, in the same way as above, add these changes to your staging area and create another commit with a descriptive message of your choice. Check that this commit appears in the log as well.\n  Let's go ahead and push these commits so far to the remote repository. Run the following, replacing \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; with the branch you are working on (if you forget what it is called, you can run git status or git branch and copy the branch name from there!):\n  1git push origin \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt;  Navigate out of the some-files directory, so you are back in the root of the repository. Display the contents of the files there. One of the files seems to be out of place; move this file to the some-files directory. Check that this file is now in the proper place by listing the contents of the directory some-files. Check the status of the repository again (git status). Notice that it thinks the file was deleted from the repository, but that there is now a new \u0026quot;untracked file\u0026quot; of the same name in some-files! Let's now add all of the files to the staging area and check the status of the repository again. What does it look like now? Let's commit these staged changes and check the log again to make sure they appeared. In the root of the repository, go ahead and delete the delete-me directory. (Hint: what option do you need to include to remove a directory?). Add, commit, and push these changes.  4. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub As we did at the end of last class, let's create a pull request to merge this test-branch to main.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch: on the left side, there should be a button with main and a down arrow -- click this and select your branch. At the top, if there is an option to \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot;, click that, otherwise click on the \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot; tab and then \u0026quot;New pull request\u0026quot;.\nSince this is a forked branch, we are given the option of submitting a pull request against the original repository that we forked from (listed under base repository). This is often how you can contribute to open source projects -- by forking the repository, making your changes, and then submitting a PR against the original repo for the maintainers of the project to accept or reject.\nFor now, let's just PR within the fork, so change the base repository to be the forked repo. (The base repository and head repository should match, but the base branch should be main).\nAssign someone in your group and one of the teachers to review your pull request.\nTake a moment to review any PRs you were tagged on.\n5. [Optional] Advanced Git practice This is a section for if you are done with the earlier sections and want to try some new git commands out. This is completely optional and more complicated than the previous sections! Remember, you can play around with this repo as much as you want; use it to create new scenarios and test out Git commands to understand what they do. This is a toy repository, and you can always clone a fresh copy (first part of the activity) to restart from scratch, so there is low risk here :)\nFirst, we can use the git reset command to undo changes that we have made.\n Check that you are still on \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/test-branch. Then, checkout a new branch \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/undo-changes, replacing \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt; with your GitHub username. Look at the git log, which should include all of the commits we made in the previous section. Let's say that we now want to \u0026quot;undo\u0026quot; the changes that we made in the last commit, deleting the delete-me folder. We realized after pushing this change that we actually want to keep this folder. Find and copy the commit hash (looks like a long string of letters and numbers, something like: 6ff15394c57d1d105482efd9359d7a061995fedc) of the commit right before this in the commit log. Let's now \u0026quot;reset\u0026quot; the state of the repository to this commit, right before we committed the change to delete the directory, replacing \u0026lt;commit-hash\u0026gt; with the hash from your commit log:  1git reset --hard \u0026lt;commit-hash\u0026gt;  Check the git status of your directory and the git log now. What is the most recent commit in the commit log now? Check the contents of the repository. Is the delete-me folder present or not? Check the contents of the delete-me folder. Feel free to try resetting the repository to different states (different commit hashes) and exploring a bit. Once you are done, you can checkout (get back onto) the main or test-branch from the earlier section and deleting the branch you just created:  1git checkout main 2git branch -D \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/undo-changes If you still have time and want to continue playing around with Git, try to merge two branches that have made changes on the same file. You can see how Git tries to do this automatically and you may have to \u0026quot;resolve merge conflicts\u0026quot; if Git is not able to automatically merge the changes. To create a situation like this:\n Create two branches from the same \u0026quot;base\u0026quot; and checkout one of them. Remember, replace \u0026lt;new-branch-1\u0026gt; nd \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt; with branch names of your choice. (Bonus: look up how to do this via the git branch command instead of git checkout -b): 1git checkout -b \u0026lt;new-branch-1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base-branch\u0026gt; 2git checkout -b \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base-branch\u0026gt;  Modify and commit to a.txt on  Make a different change to the same file, a.txt on  Try to merge one branch into the other by checkout out  and then running git merge \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt;. Did you get any merge conflicts? See what the contents of file a.txt are. Try to fix any merge conflicts and commit this merge. Check the log to see what the merge commit looks like.

It’s written in what people like to call “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` ).\nUnlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments.\nTo get started with the tutorial let´s jump here:\nMARKDOWN TUTORIAL\nCreating your own journal! 0.

For customization see additional options.    1. Fork and clone your new Journal First, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the journal. (If you don't already have a designated folder for class materials, create a directory for this and navigate into it.) Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of another repository, usually one that is stored on a remote server like GitHub.\nFork this repository. In the top right corner, click Fork. You may be prompted with a question like \u0026quot;Where should we fork this repository to?\u0026quot; If so, click your GitHub username; this will create a copy of the repository to your account.\nYou should then be automatically taken to the main page of this repository.\nOn the upper right side, click Code (in green) and copy the HTTPS link. Then in your terminal run git clone \u0026lt;link-you-copied\u0026gt;. For example, this should look something like the following (with github-username replaced with your own github username):\n1git clone https://github.com/ReDI-School/spring-2021-intro-to-programming-md-journal Check that this directory now exists. (Hint: list the contents of the directory you are in, and make sure you see the cloned folder.)\nMove into that directory (small hint -\u0026gt; write cd spring and then press the key TAB and it will autocomplete):\n1cd spring-2021-intro-to-programming-md-journal Check the status of the git repository:\n1git status You should see output something like:\n1On branch main 2Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/main\u0026#39;. 3 4nothing to commit, working tree clean If so, great! You have successfully forked and cloned this repository. If not, check in with someone in your group or raise your hand so one of the teachers to help before moving on to the next steps.\n2. Checkout a new branch One of the great things about Git is being able to work on the same repository as others at the same time. A typical way of doing this when working on a project is by creating and checking out a new branch (via git checkout -b \u0026lt;branch-name\u0026gt;), making changes and committing your work, and pushing this work to your separate branch. Once you are ready to publish your changes to the main branch, you can create a pull request (PR) to have others review your changes and merge them to the main branch.\nEven though you are working on your own repository alone (since you forked, this is your own repository), let's practice creating a new branch so we can make some changes there and eventually merge this back to the main branch. Let's call this branch \u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch (leave out the \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, for example, for me, I would call the branch omarsotillofranco/journal1):\n1git checkout -b \u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch Check the status of the repository again before moving on to the next step, and make sure that you are on the correct branch. (Hint: run git status which displays the branch you are on, and make sure this is what you expect.)\n3. Open with VSCode the folder you have just created Open VScode! :D once you are there let's click on file in the top left corner and click on Open.... Look for the the folder in your system you have just created (probably should be around /home) and click it.\nYour VSCode should show now on the left side the differents files and folders from the current scenario.\n4. Complete the tasks in the README.md file from the repository you have just created. In the README.md file from the repo you have just copied there is a section called ## TASKS. Go slowly one by one and complete them by marking them with a X\n5. Adding and committing some changes Once completed! let's make the world know about our recipes. This activity should remind you a bit of the directory \u0026quot;maze\u0026quot; exploration activity that we did with Ergün last week.\n  Check the status of the repository via git status. If you do not see something that says you deleted a file, please ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on.\n  Stage the changes by running git add . or git add --all and check the status again to make sure the changes have shown up in your staging area. They should be green\n  Create a commit now to \u0026quot;save\u0026quot; your changes--in this case, the deleted file. Try to leave a helpful commit message like below, replacing  with the file you deleted:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Created my first journal!\u0026#34;   Check that the commit was successful by checking the status of the repository (git status) and checking the log (git log). You should see the commit message that you added at the top of the log, in addition to some previous commits from before you cloned the repository.\n  Let's go ahead and push these commits so far to the remote repository. Run the following, replacing \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; with the branch you are working on (if you forget what it is called, you can run git status or git branch and copy the branch name from there!):\n  1git push origin \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; 6. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub As we did at the end of last class, let's create a pull request to merge this test-branch to main.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch: on the left side, there should be a button with main and a down arrow -- click this and select your branch. At the top, if there is an option to \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot;, click that, otherwise click on the \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot; tab and then \u0026quot;New pull request\u0026quot;.\nSince this is a forked branch, we are given the option of submitting a pull request against the original repository that we forked from (listed under base repository). This is often how you can contribute to open source projects -- by forking the repository, making your changes, and then submitting a PR against the original repo for the maintainers of the project to accept or reject.\nFor now, let's just PR within the fork, so change the base repository to be the forked repo. (The base repository and head repository should match, but the base branch should be main).\nAssign someone in your group to the PR 'it can be seen in the right section and approve and merge the changes into main.\n7. (Optional) Let´s swap places Now it is time for your partner to repeat what you have done.\nBUT! instead of forking the repository we will clone directly your partner repository so both of you can contribute towards a shared journal.\nFor that let´s do the following:\n Ask your partner for an URL pointing to his journal repository that both of you have created and existts in Github. Let´s clone the repository (make sure the Pull Request opened is merged and that the main branch has the content you just created) Add some new files, folders, images and after add, commit and push your changes.

Spend some time thinking about which option may make sense for you. VSCode or PyCharm will give you the most options and would enable you to continue practicing your command line and git/GitHub skills. Ideally, try getting set up with at least one of the options. We will then troubleshoot and go through this in class for folks who ran into any issues with their setup. (Optional practice) go through exercises on w3 schools for Python through Functions section OR on particular areas that you would like to review. This is entirely optional but good practice! No need to go over Lambda, Classes, Inheritance, or Modules as we have not seen these yet.  Python Installation Overview Google Colab Overview  free, requires a google account (gmail) no need to install Python on your computer, as Colab comes with an interpreter built-in that can run your code easy to create a new document or create a \u0026quot;copy\u0026quot; of assignments that we create can use the UI to save copies to GitHub or to your Google Drive makes it easy to execute and write code in notebook \u0026quot;cells\u0026quot;; it's possible to mix code and text in a readable and clear way notebook-style is very common in the Data Science space, so if you think you may want to go in the direction of data science or analytics, this could be a great option  here's an example iPython Notebook in Colab if you'd like to get a sense of what these are!   can be used for writing Python Notebooks (.ipynb only, no pure .py files) one of the options used in the Intro to Python course with ReDI school recommended if you don't feel as comfortable installing Python on your machine or had difficulties with this, you don't want to work on the command line or use git/GitHub, or you are particularly interested in learning data science/analysis in the future  Setup instructions  Visit Google Colab. You may need to login with your gmail account or else create a Google Account in order to use Google Colab. In the bottom right, click on New Notebook. This will create a new Python Notebook in your Google Drive. Some notes:  You can rename this file by clicking on the name (probably Untitled0) in the top left and renaming this. (See diagram below). (Note) If you want to save this Notebook in GitHub, you can create a repository in GitHub and initialize it with a README or other file. Then, in your Colab notebook, click File \u0026gt; Save Copy to GitHub. You may need to authorize your account (let GitHub know that it's ok for Colab to write to your repositories on your behalf), but then you can select this repository, and Colab will save a copy to it with the current state. If you make changes that you want to commit, you can repeat this process.   In your notebook, click into the cell and write a Python statement of your choice (perhaps, a function to print hello world or add two numbers together). Then, click the play button (or use Shift + Enter) to execute this line of code. After a few seconds, the result of the expression should appear under the cell.  Done! Optionally: check out the Welcome to Colaboratory notebook that Google has provided, and watch the short introductory video in it. This will just give you a sense of what you can do in Colab.  VSCode  free IDE that we have previously used in this class requires you to have installed a version of Python on your machine can be used for writing and executing Python Notebooks (like in Colab) as well as pure Python scripts and modules (.ipynb and .py files) can install extensions to add Python syntax-highlighting and coding tips will require you to continue practicing your command line and git/GitHub skills recommended if you feel comfortable installing Python, want to continue using the command line to navigate your file system and using git/GitHub as you develop your project, or you want to continue deepening your knowledge of one IDE rather than trying out a new platform  Setup Instructions   Download and install Python at this link (latest version -- 3.9.4).

Lesson Goals  Have a working development environment on Python. Continue writing code in Python.  1. Check-In  What was particularly challenging last class? Are there any remaining questions from last class? Were there any challenges understanding the pre-requisites for today's class?  2. Short review of each installation option  Colab, PyCharm, VSCode We will also take a look at a Python Notebook (.ipynb) vs. normal Python file .py. What is the difference between these two formats? How do we run each of these?  Notebooks are made up of \u0026quot;cells\u0026quot; which allow you to execute blocks of code. Cells can also contain Markdown or text, so these can be useful for demoing information or for storing plots, charts, and doing data analysis. Notebooks are commonly used in the Data Science and Machine Learning fields. .py files are Python files, and can be executed by a Python interpreter via path/to/python/installation filename.py where you replace path/to/python/installation with the path to the location that you installed Python on your machine and filename.py with the name of your Python file. Your interpreter will also look for a main.py in your module or the statement: if __name__ == '__main__': in a file to know where to begin running your code. This is where you can tell the interpreter to start calling your functions.   We will take a look at the IDLE Python terminal that comes with your Python installation and how you can interactively execute lines of code here. (There are other Python terminals that you can install or use, such as ipython.) This can be useful for testing out your logic and syntax as you are writing a longer program as well!  3. Troubleshooting in Groups We will split up into groups based on whether folks have Python installed or are having issues so that we can troubleshoot and get everyone set up as quickly as possible :)\nGroups that are done with installation can start working on the Python problems from the following section.\n4. for and while loops Loops are a tool that help us execute a block of code a specified amount of times or based on a condition. In Python, there are two loops: for and while loops.\nwhile loops while loops allow us to execute a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to True.\nPlease excuse the ugly diagram :)\nSyntax:\n1while condition: 2 # do things Examples:\n1# This is called an \u0026#34;infinite loop\u0026#34; since the condition is always True!! 2while True: 3 print(\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m an infinite loop! I won\u0026#39;t stop unless I\u0026#39;m forced to!\u0026#34;) 1count = 0 2while count \u0026lt; 10: 3 print(\u0026#34;hello #\u0026#34;, count) 4 count += 1 5 # outputs: 6 # hello # 0 7 # hello # 1 8 # hello # 2 9 # hello # 3 10 # hello # 4 11 # hello # 5 12 # hello # 6 13 # hello # 7 14 # hello # 8 15 # hello # 9 16 for loops for loops provide a way to go through each value (or set of values) in an iterable (e.g. a list, string, dictionary, etc.) and execute a block of code that uses that value.\nSyntax:\n1for variable(s) in iterable: 2 # do things Examples: (feel free to try executing these in your IDLE terminal, notebook cell, VSCode, or PyCharm :)\n1for num in [1, 2, 3]: 2 print(num) 3 # outputs: 4 # 1 5 # 2 6 # 3 1for letter in \u0026#39;word\u0026#39;: 2 new_word = letter + \u0026#39;!!\u0026#39; 3 print(new_word) 4 # outputs: 5 # w!! 6 # o!! 7 # r!! 8 # d!! 1# python 2for num, letter in [(1, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;), (2, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;)]: 3 # Here, we convert number to string using `str` before concatenating with another string 4 print(str(num) + letter) 5 # outputs: 6 # 1a 7 # 2b 8 With for loops, it can also be useful to use the range operator in Python which creates an iterable of numbers. The syntax of this is range(start, end, step), but you will also see this as just range(start, end) or range(end) (in this last case, the start is assumed to be 0). Note that the end value is not included (in other words, \u0026quot;numbers starting with start up until (not through) end\u0026quot;). Here are some examples:\n1for i in range(3): 2 print(i) 3 # outputs: 4 # 0 5 # 1 6 # 2 1list(range(1, 4)) # we can create a list out of a `range` 2# [1, 2, 3] 1list(range(-1, 9, 3)) # here, the step (space between values) is 3 2# [-1, 2, 5, 8] 5. Hands-on Python Tasks Work in groups to solve the following tasks in your new Python Dev setup. You are not expected to get through all of these in class, and they range from easier to harder.\nOptionaally, you may send in a link to a GitHub repository with your solutions (if working in VSCode or PyCharm) or share your notebook (if working in Colab) if you would like feedback on your work :) I will also release solutions later.\nNote: if you are writing in Colab or a Python Notebook, then try to keep each task in a separate code cell. If you are writing in a pure Python file, consider wrapping each task in a function (that is, write a function to solve the task) and call these functions in the if __name__ == '__main__': block to test out your code. This might look something like:\n1# in your file: 2def task_n(a, b): 3 # code to solve task 1 4 ... 5 6 return answer_to_task_n 7 8if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 9 print(task_n(1, 2)) # prints output of task_n 10 Note: it can be helpful to test out your functions by making sure that the functions return what you expect for a few different inputs. Make sure to try out a variety of inputs including some \u0026quot;edge cases\u0026quot;, or cases that are trickier and can cause problems. These edge cases often have to do with \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; or empty-inputs. (Optional): In Python, you can also write assert statements, where you would state what you believe the function to output to be, and it fails if this is not the case.\nLet's use an example task 0 to illustrate all the points above.\nTask 0 (warmup) Write a function called add_10 that takes in an integer, adds 10, and returns this value. Test out these steps and make sure you feel comfortable with the process. The following tasks won't have a walk through, but you should follow the same rough process.\nSteps:\n Write out your function skeleton, or the empty function with the name and parameters. (Note: n is commonly used to denote a number, but you can also write more descriptive variable names):  1def add_10(n): 2 # TODO: add logic to add 10 3 return \u0026#34;Not implemented\u0026#34; Let's call this function somewhere so we can see what it's outputting. In a .py file:  1if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 2 # the text is not required, but it helps me see what I called to get the output 3 print(\u0026#34;add_10(3): \u0026#34;, add_10(3)) # for now, this returns \u0026#34;add_10(3): Not implemented\u0026#34; 4 Let's add in some logic and check the values that it is outputting. If these values don't match your expectations (which often happens in programming), then take another look and try to understand what's going wrong. You can add print statements in your code as well to tell you what the values of different variables and conditions are while you are running your code. You should feel encouraged to look things up when you run into issues as well.  1def add_10(n): 2 return n + 10 3 4if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 5 print(\u0026#34;add_10(3): \u0026#34;, add_10(3)) # this should now print \u0026#34;add_10(3): 13\u0026#34; 6 print(\u0026#34;add_10(-10): \u0026#34;, add_10(-10)) # this should now print \u0026#34;add_10(-10): 0\u0026#34; 7 Optional: you can also use assert statements to confirm your expectations. This is a way of writing simple \u0026quot;test cases\u0026quot; to make sure your logic works. This looks something like:  1def add_10(n): 2 return n + 10 3 4if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 5 assert add_10(3) == 13 6 assert add_10(-10) == 0 7 assert add_10(0) == 10 8 What happens if the assert statement is wrong? (Hint: try out something like assert add_10(3) == 5 which we expect to fail and see what happens.)\nYou can also add this in to a test function to organize your code:\n1def add_10(n): 2 return n + 10 3 4def test_add_10(): 5 assert add_10(3) == 13 6 assert add_10(-10) == 0 7 assert add_10(0) == 10 8 9 10if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 11 test_add_10() # expect no output if all assertions passed 12 Task 1 Write a function called longer_string that takes in two strings and returns the longer of the two. If they are the same length, return the first string.\nTask 2 Write a function called is_odd that takes in an integer and returns True if the number is odd and False otherwise.\nHint: look up (Google) what the modulo (%) operator in Python is and use it to determine if a number is odd or even.  Task 3 (parts 1, 2) Write a function called hello_world_n that takes in an integer n and prints \u0026quot;Hello, world!\u0026quot; n times.\n do this using a for loop do this using a while loop  Task 4 Write a function called sum_list that takes in a list of integers (i.e. [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]) and returns the sum of them. Do not use the sum function in your logic, but you can use this to test your logic! (Hint: assert sum(lst) == ...)\nTask 5 Write a function that takes in a list of integers (i.e. [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]) and prints the value of each element greater than 4. For example:\n  input: [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]\n1# output: 2# 10 3# 5   input: [4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4]\n1# output: 2# 5 3# 6 4# 6 5# 5   input: [4, 3, 2, 1]\n1# no output   Optional Challenge: change your function to take in a second parameter, min_val. Now, print all values in the list greater than this value.\nExample input: [4, 3, 2, 1], 2\n1 # output: 2 # 4 3 # 3   (Challenge) Task 6 (parts 1, 2) Note: this one is optional and meant to be challenging! :)\nLike with task 4, do not use the Python function max in your function, but you can use this to test it out!\n Write a function that takes in a list of integers (i.e. [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]) and returns largest value in the list. Write a function that takes in a list of strings (i.e. ['a', 'asdf', '']) and returns the longest string in the list.  (Challenge) Task 7 (parts 1, 2, 3) Note: this one is optional and meant to be challenging! :)\n  Write a function that takes in an integer and prints all numbers below it that are divisible by 3. (Hint: recall Task 2 -- how can you check if a number is divisible by 3?)\nExample input: 12\n1# output: 2# 0 3# 3 4# 6 5# 9    Modify the function to return how many numbers are divisible by 3, in addition to printing each number. (i.e. the returned value for the example input above would be 4 (0, 3, 6, 9)).\n  Modify this function to make it general -- if the function takes in n and k, find out how many numbers less than n are divisible by k.\nExample input: 8, 2\n1# output: 2# 0 3# 2 4# 4 5# 6 6# returns 4   Additional Resources  W3 schools Python while loops W3 schools Python for loops Tutorialspoint loops in Python additional practice problems on loops and conditions (note: some are challenging!) additional practice problems (note: challenging!)
