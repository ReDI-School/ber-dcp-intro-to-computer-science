HTML, HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a Web Browser.\nWeb brosers fetch HTML documents from Web servers over the internet or on your laptop\nStructure of HTML Documents HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages and specify how text, images, video and interactive forms can be embedded on a web page which is being displayed in the browser.\nHTML elements are specified using tags that are within angle brackets \u0026lt;\u0026gt; for example the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag. Tags usually come in pairs of start and end tags. For example \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;. Usually when speaking about HTML tags, we simply ignore whether it is a start or end tag and simply use the tag name.\nThe set of all start and end tags in a HTML document form a hierarchy (just like a family tree). For example in the HTML markup below, the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag is the parent of the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags. The \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; tag is a child of the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag and a grandchild of the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag.\n1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;This is a title\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello world!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 9 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 11\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Important HTML Tags    Tag Purpose Playground     \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Creates an HTML document    \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; Contains the title of the document \u0026amp; other info that isn't displayed Try it   \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; Contains the visible parts of the document    \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Specifies the name of the document in the browser title bar; when bookmarking pages, this is what is bookmarked    \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Creates text headlines.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.\nCSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.\nCSS Rule A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:\n1/* The selector \u0026#34;p\u0026#34; indicates that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */ 2p { 3 /* The \u0026#34;color\u0026#34; property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */ 4 color: yellow; 5 6 /* The \u0026#34;background-color\u0026#34; property defines the background color, in this case black. */ 7 background-color: black; 8} How does CSS Actually Work When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.\n  The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).\n  It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.\n  The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.\n  The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different \u0026quot;buckets\u0026quot;, e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).\n  The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.\n  The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).\n  How CSS is structured There are typically 3 ways we do that to include CSS in a HTML Page:\n Inline CSS  1\u0026lt;h1 style=\u0026#34;color: blue\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Hello world!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; Internal CSS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; 3 h1 { 4 color: blue; 5 } 6 \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; External CSS  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;style.css\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; CSS Selectors  Element  The first way to select an HTML element is by simply using the name:\n1h1 { 2 font-size: 20px; 3} 4p { 5 color: green; 6} 7div { 8 margin: 10px; 9} We are selecting different elements like h1, p, div and giving them different style attributes. The font-size controls the size of the text, color sets the text color, and margin adds spacing around the element.\nClass  Another way of selecting HTML elements is by using the class attribute. In HTML, we can assign different classes to our elements. Each element can have multiple classes, and each class can also be applied to multiple elements as well.\n1\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;container\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;This is heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 4 5.container { background-color: blue; } In the code above, we have assigned the class of container to the div element. In the stylesheet, we select our class using .className format and giving it a blue background color.\nID  Like classes, we can also use IDs to select HTML elements and apply styling to them. The only difference between class and ID is that one ID can be assigned to only one HTML element in one page.\n1\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;p id=\u0026#34;para1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This is a paragraph\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 4 5#para1 { color: green; font-size: 16px; } Activities   Add a style sheet to the journal you were working on previously, and change the colors, fonts, etc. of your journal. Be creative here! Make sure to commit and push the changes to your repository afterwards. Some example tasks:\n Change the color and font size of all of the h1 (large heading) tags (hint: use element selection) Create several CSS classes to style the color, font, font size, background color, and alignment of text. Apply these classes to several elements of your journal. Create an \u0026quot;id\u0026quot; to select a particular paragraph or div in your journal and style (i.e. change the color or background of the paragraph or div).

Add the following HTML page structure and make sure to save the changes:\n1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;assets/css/style.css\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;PLEASE CHANGE ME\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 9 \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;!-- Leave this space empty for content --\u0026gt; 11 \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 12\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; üìñ What does each of these lines mean?\n The page is defined as an HTML document:  1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt;  The character set is defined as UTF-8:  \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026quot;UTF-8\u0026quot;\u0026gt; A meta viewport tag is used to ensure the site looks good on different screen sizes e.g. mobile, laptop:  \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026quot;viewport\u0026quot; content=\u0026quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\u0026quot;\u0026gt; A link to the CSS file we will use to style the site is added. This file is located elsewhere in the repository (at ):  \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;assets/css/style.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; A title is added:  \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; PLEASE CHANGE ME \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; The visual website content will be contained within the body. Right now it contains only a comment:  \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Leave this space empty for content --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; Now view this in the browser.\n‚úèÔ∏è First we need to know the present working directory. Open the terminal and cd into the website repository. Then print the current working directory (hint: pwd) and copy the output.\nOpen your browser and copy the following into the address bar (but replace YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY with the paste of your working directory):\nfile://YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY/index.html Note: if you have trouble finding the file path, you can also right-click on the file name (in the left-hand file tree) in VSCode and select \u0026quot;Copy Path\u0026quot;, then paste this path into your browser where you normally type a URL. This should also take you to the same path.\nYou should see:\n The text in the tab says PLEASE CHANGE ME The webpage is blank  üé® Lastly, change the text PLEASE CHANGE ME in index.html to my website (or your preferred text), and refresh the page. What has changed?\nNow, in the index.html file within the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; tags, type some text (for example: \u0026quot;nothing to see here\u0026quot;) and save the file. Double check that this text appears on your web page, and then remove this text and save again. (We will fill the page with more interesting things in the next steps!)\nIf nothing has changed, make sure that you have saved the changes you made to index.html! The browser will only display saved file changes!\nGroup Check-In:\nMake sure everyone:\n is able to view the file in their browser. has made the above changes to this file.   2. Navigation Bar (navbar) We have an empty webpage - so much space to fill! Let's start with a navbar.\nA navbar contains a list of the places to navigate to on a website e.g. Home, Notifications, Messages.\nOur website will contain three sections: Home, About and Contact.\nContent (HTML) ‚úèÔ∏è Add the following in between the two \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags (replacing the comment).\n1\u0026lt;!-- Header --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;header class=\u0026#34;intro\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;!-- Navbar --\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;navbar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#about\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#contact\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; üìñ What does this mean?\n The \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; tag is used to specify that a header is added to the page. This typically contains a navigation bar and/or introductory information.  1\u0026lt;header class=\u0026#34;intro\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 ... 3\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; The \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag represents a new section or division. The \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag is used to link from one page to another, or if a # is used, to link to another section on the same page. Later on we will create sections for About and Contact.  1\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;navbar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#about\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;#contact\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; 5\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Go to your browser and refresh the page to display this content. You will see that the navbar content is present but is unstyled, so we will add some styling with CSS.\nGroup Check-In:\nMake sure everyone:\n can see an unstyled navbar on their webpage  Questions:\n What is a div? What CSS classes do the div and a elements have in the snippet you added above?   Styling (CSS) ‚úèÔ∏è In your IDE open the file: assets/css/style.css.\n Add the following to style and set the colour of the navbar:  1body { 2 margin: 0px; 3} 4 5.navbar { 6 background-color: #5354f4; 7 overflow: hidden; 8} üé® The text #5354f4 represents a hex colour code. Use a colour picker to choose a different colour and change this!\nGroup Check-In:\n Why did the background color only change for the navbar and not the entire page?   Next, style the navigation bar links by adding the following to style.css:  1/*Navigation bar links*/ 2.navbar a { 3 display: block; 4 padding: 20px 25px; 5 text-align: center; 6 text-decoration: none; 7 float: left; 8 color: white; 9} Recall that the above CSS syntax (thing1 thing2 {...) means: \u0026quot;style all of the thing2's within thing1\u0026quot;, so in the above example, we are styling all of the a elements within the .navbar class.\nGroup Check-In:\nüé® For each of these items, see if you can figure out what it does either by making a search on Ecosia or by trial and error (i.e. editing/removing them, saving your changes, and seeing what happens to your web page).\n Lastly change what happens when a mouse is hovering over a link, by adding the following:  1/*Hovering over navigation bar*/ 2.navbar a:hover { 3 background-color: #faf800; 4 color: black; 5} üé® Again, change each of these to understand what they are doing, and check in with your group about this.\n3. Adding an introduction header Within the header, we want to introduce ourselves and say hello to the world. We will add a greeting here.\nContent (HTML) ‚úèÔ∏è Return to the index.html file and add the following content after the navbar section and still between the \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; tags, and save:\n1\u0026lt;!-- Introduction --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h1 class=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Hello, my name is ___\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;h3 class=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;My title\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; 5\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; The \u0026lt;h\u0026gt; tags are used to create different headings and subheadings. Here \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is used as the main heading, and \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt; as a subheading.\nüé® Now customise the greeting and title with your name and title e.g. your title could be Redi School Student, Programmer or even an emoji like: üíª.\nGroup Check-In:\nMake sure everyone can view the new text on their website.\nQuestions:\n What is the difference between h1, h2, h3, ...? What does the number reference?   Styling (CSS) ‚úèÔ∏è Open style.css again.\nWe will change the font and position the intro text in the centre of the screen. Then we will add a background image.\n Change the font  Where you have previously added:\nbody { margin: 0px; } Replace this with the following:\n1body, 2html { 3 height: 100%; 4 margin: 0px; 5} 6body, 7h1, 8h2, 9h3, 10h4, 11h5, 12h6, 13p { 14 font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 15 font-weight: 500; 16 color: #5354f4; 17} This will:\n make the body have 100% of the screen height. change the font for all text types to Arial, and change the text colour and weight.  üé® Again, customise the following:\n font font-weight colour  Now we will center the text in the screen  ‚úèÔ∏è Add the following to the CSS file:\n1/*Introduction*/ 2.summary { 3 position: absolute; 4 top: 50%; 5 left: 50%; 6 transform: translate(-50%, -50%); 7 8 text-align: center; 9 letter-spacing: 4px; 10}  Group Check-In:\nRead through each of these items. As a group, can you figure out what each of them is doing? Try searching Ecosia (example search terms: \u0026quot;css property transform\u0026quot;, for the transform property above), asking one of the instructors or experimenting by changing them.\n Lastly, we will add a background image  For this, we will need the image that you selected as part of your preparation work.\nSave this image to the folder: assets/images and give it the name background.jpg (or if it is an png image, background.png)\n‚úèÔ∏è Now add the following to style.css:\n1.intro { 2 height: 100%; 3 background-image: url(\u0026#39;../images/background.png\u0026#39;); 4 background-size: cover; 5} If your background image has a .jpg extension, change this to url(\u0026quot;../images/background.jpg\u0026quot;);.\nGroup Check-In:\nMake sure that each group member has a background image showing up on their website. If anyone's is not working, have that person share their screen and debug as a group.\n 4. About section ‚úèÔ∏è Next we will add an about section. Between the \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; tag and \u0026lt;/body tag, add the following:\nContent (HTML) 1\u0026lt;!-- About --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;about\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;about\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;About Me\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some things I like are ___ . I am learning about ____.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 5\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; üé® Customise the text between the \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; paragraph tags.\nStyling (CSS) ‚úèÔ∏è To style the text in the About section, add the following:\n1/*about section*/ 2 3.about h2, 4p { 5 text-align: left; 6 padding-left: 25%; 7 padding-top: 1%; 8 padding-bottom: 1%; 9} 10 11.about p { 12 font-size: 20px; 13} This will align the text and change the font size of the paragraph.\nüé® Change the font size and padding.\n5. Contact section Finally, we will add a Contact section with a list of links for how to contact us.\nContent (HTML) ‚úèÔ∏è Add the following underneath the About section:\n1\u0026lt;!-- Contact --\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;contact\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;contact\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Contact\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://github.com/\u0026lt;exampleuser\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;GitHub\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;mailto:example@email.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Email\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 7 \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/\u0026lt;exampleuser\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Twitter\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; 8 \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; 9\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; This creates a Contact section with an unordered list (\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;). Each list item \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; is a link to different forms of contact.\nüé® Customise this list by adding/removing/editing the contents (remember to remove the \u0026lt;\u0026gt; when substituting in your information), but don't add any contact details that you are not comfortable with. Keep in mind that if you do not push this to GitHub, you are viewing and working on a local file and not a published internet website.\nStyling (CSS) We will style the Contact section similiarly to the About section. The main difference is that this time we have a list and we want to style the list and its items.\n‚úèÔ∏è Add the following to the style.css document.\n1.contact h2, 2ul, 3li { 4 text-align: left; 5 padding-left: 25%; 6 padding-top: 1%; 7 padding-bottom: 1%; 8} 9 10.contact li { 11 padding-left: 1%; 12} 13 14.contact a { 15 border-bottom: dotted; 16 text-decoration: none; 17} üé® Learn what each of these is doing by customising the section, looking up what they mean or removing them entirely!\nGroup Check-In:\n What do each of the CSS properties mean? Each group member should present their website to the rest of the group   6. Follow-up Here are some things you can do to continue your work:\n Compile a list of questions: what didn't you understand? Share the questions in the team slack. Remember if you are unsure about something, then someone else probably is too. Sharing questions openly helps everyone learn, including the teachers and instructors. Further customise the website by adding or removing sections, for example adding a section for photos or fun facts. Commit your changes and push your code to GitHub. Publish your website on GitHub using GitHub Pages  Next class preparation \u0026amp; Homework  Recommended: go through the tutorial again on your own and create a new website. Commit and push these changes to a repository. If you run into any problems, please reach out to the teachers on Slack, and free to send the link to the repository for your website if you would like!

Set up a new repository  Open the terminal. Create a new directory and move to the new directory:  mkdir date-time-website \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd date-time-website  Create a README:  echo \u0026quot;# Time and Date Website\u0026quot; \u0026gt; README.md  Initialise a new repository and change the branch to main:  git init git checkout -b main  Create the first commit:  git a . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initialise the repository with a README\u0026quot; 2. Create the HTML files  Open VSCode from the terminal:  code .   Create a file called index.html\n  Add the following to index.html:\n  1\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 6 \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; Date and Time Website \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; 8 9\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 10 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Today\u0026#39;s date is Tuesday, 13th April \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 11 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; The time is 20:30 CET \u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 12\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; 13 14\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; This sets up the content of the webpage. But there is a problem! We have hard-coded the date and time. To hard-code something means to set it so that it cannot be changed or updated. The webpage will always say it is Tuesday, 13th of April, even when it is not. In Section 3 we will use Javascript to display the correct date and time always.\n  Run LiveServer\n  Add and commit this to git.\n[hint: git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, replacing ... with a meningful message.]\n  3. Create the CSS Files   Create a file called style.css.\n  Add the following to style.css to style the page:\n  1body { 2 text-align: center; 3 background-color: teal; 4 font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 5 font-weight: 500; 6 color: silver; 7}  In index.html, append the following between the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tags to reference the css file:  1 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;style.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt;   Refresh LiveServer\n  Change the colours and font weight.\n  Add and commit your changes to git.\n[hint: git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, replacing ... with a meaningful message.]\n  4. Introduce Javascript to find the date and time   Create a file called script.js\n  Add the following to the script:\n  1var date = new Date(); 2 3// We can take a look at what d contains with the console: 4console.log(date) 5 6// Extract the date from d: 7var currentDate = date.toDateString() 8 9// Extract the time from d: 10var currentTime = date.toLocaleTimeString() 11 12document.body.innerHTML = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Today\u0026#39;s date is \u0026#34; + currentDate + \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; The time is \u0026#34; + currentTime + \u0026#34;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Here we use the Javascript Date object to retrieve the date and time and assign it to a variable, d. We then make use of two methods toDateString() and toLocalTimeString() to extract only the information that we want (the date and time) from the variable, d and assign this information to two new variables, currentDate and currentTime. The document.body.innerHTML. If this is your first time encountering the term variable, one of the teachers can explain what the term means.\n Replace the following in index.html:  1\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Today\u0026#39;s date is Tuesday, 13th April \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; The time is 20:30 CET \u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; 4\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; with :\n1 2\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;./script.js\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 4\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;   Refresh LiveServer\n  Use your browser's Developer Tools to inspect the page, and take a look at what was logged in the Javascript you wrote (console.log(date))\n  Add and commit these changes to git.\n[hint: git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, replacing ... with a meaningful message.]\n  5.

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code. Here is a PacMan game you can play using your webcam, a 3D home design website and a cool 3D demo of a ball in water, all of which are made using mostly JavaScript and push the edges of what you can do in your browser with JavaScript) It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.\n JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. JavaScript can both be used as a client-side and server-side programming language. This means it can run on your browser on your desktop or mobile device and can also run inside \u0026quot;Node\u0026quot; on a web server. JavaScript is an untyped programming language. This means you don't need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it but it is understood based on the value you assign to the variable.   1\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Player 1: Chris\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 1p { 2 font-family: \u0026#39;helvetica neue\u0026#39;, helvetica, sans-serif; 3 text-align: center; 4 border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6); 5 color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6); 6 display: inline-block; 7 cursor: pointer; 8} 1const para = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;); 2 3para.addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, updateName); 4 5function updateName() { 6 let name = prompt(\u0026#39;Enter a new name\u0026#39;); 7 para.textContent = \u0026#39;Player 1: \u0026#39; + name; 8}   What can JavaScript do The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:\n  Store useful values inside variables.\n  Operate on text pieces to form new text pieces\n  Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.\n  Dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a web page ( with the DOM API)\n  Retrieves geographical information ( with the Geolocation API )\n  Create animated 2D and 3D graphics (with the Canvas and WebGL APIs)\n  Play audio and video right in a web page, create audio and video calls ( with the Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC)\n  And much,much more!\n  How do you add JavaScript to your page There are typically 3 ways we do that to include JS in a HTML Page ( just like CSS):\n Inline JS. This is typically not used or should not be used because it makes your HTML harder to read and maintain (and it goes against the principle of separation of concerns - HTML should just dictate your page structure and should be contained in the .html files, while the JavaScript code which makes it dynamic should be in separate .js files)  1\u0026lt;!--Here the onclick=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; part is JavaScript and it is embedded in the HTML--\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;button onclick=\u0026#34;javascript:alert(\u0026#39;You clicked me!\u0026#39;)\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; Internal JS. This is similar to using a style tag in the case of Internal CSS. The position of the script tag is important as it determines when the JavaScript code is executed.  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; 3 let counter = 1; 4 counter++; 5 alert(\u0026#34;Counter is now:\u0026#34;, counter); 6 \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 7\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; External JS. Here the JavaScript code is written in a separate file with the extension .js  1\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; 2 \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;script.js\u0026#34; defer\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 3 \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;script-independent.js\u0026#34; async\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 4\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; Ways of loading JS scripts  If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use async. If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using defer and put their corresponding \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.  Basic JS Guide Functions JavaScript functions are named pieces of code which can be used to achieve a particular functionality. For example, in order to show up a pop-up with the text Hello World!, the following snippet of code can be used\n1alert(\u0026#39;Hello World!\u0026#39;); Here alert is a function or piece of code available when you use JavaScript in a normal browser window. A function is called or executed by adding an opening and closing parantheses () after the name of the function. If the function takes any parameters, those are specified between the parantheses. Calling a function could change the state of the system (e.g. show a pop-up using alert) or simply return a value (e.g. return a random number between 0 and 1 in the case of Math.random).\nYou can also define your own functions to achieve some functionality and to be able to reuse this functionality. You can define a function as follows:\n1function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) { 2 console.log(parameter1); 3} The above function only prints a message in the JavaScript console. You can also create functions which return a value, you can use the return keyword. For example, the below piece of code returns the sum of the parameters passed to the function.\n1// Function definition 2function sum(a, b) { 3 return a + b; 4} 5 6// Calling the function and printing the value. 7// This statement should print the value 8 8console.log(sum(3,5)); Variables Variables are named memory locations where you can store some data. Think of variables as similar to labeled boxes which can store data.\nVariables can be declared using the let or var keywords. The difference between the two is where the declared variable remains accessible or valid. A variable declared using var can be accessed anywhere in the program. However the validity or accessibility of a variable declared using let is limited to the scope (between the curly brackets) where it is defined.\nIf the value of a variable does not need to change once it's assigned, you can use the const keyword to declare the variable.\n1var name = \u0026#34;JavaScript\u0026#34; 2const PI = 3.14 3let lastName = \u0026#34;Language\u0026#34; There are several reasons you might want to use variables:\n To store the result of any function call whose value changes each time you call it (e.g. Date() or Math.random()). To make your code readable by splitting long statements. This is illustrated with an example below  1// Long and hard to read 2console.log(document.getElementById(\u0026#39;element\u0026#39;).value); 3 4// Easier to read and debug if something goes wrong 5const element = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;element\u0026#39;); 6const value = element.value; 7console.log(value);  To avoid having to call the same function many times. Calling a function is expensive (i.e. it takes time to execute) but getting the value stored in a variable is cheap.  Data Types Variables can contain different types of values and data types. Below is a code snippet showing the simple or primitive types\n1// Any type of numerical data belongs to the Number data type 2let age = 23; 3let percentage = 30.5; 4let loss = -10.0; 5// Any textual data is stored as a String data type 6// Strings can be defined by putting the text between single or double quotes 7let name = \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;; 8let other = \u0026#39;Jane Doe\u0026#39;; 9// Booleans store true or false values. 10// They are useful to make decisions in your code 11let isMale = true; 12// undefined is a type used to indicate that the variable is not defined 13let iAmNotDefiningThis; 14// The above variable will have the data type undefined since we did not assign a value 15// Undefined can also be assigned explicitly 16let explicitUndefined = undefined; Apart from the above, there is an Object type which can be used to store more interesting data. There are primarily two sub-types which are interesting to us: Arrays and Objects.\nArrays can be used to store ordered lists of any primitive data types. Let's say you want to store the names of the top 5 largest countries in the world, in the order of their size. An array is the perfect data type for this use case.\n1countries = [\u0026#39;Russia\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Canada\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;China\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;United States\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Brazil\u0026#39;]; The advantage of an array is that it also let's you access the value stored at a particular location. The only catch is that the numbering starts at 0, not at 1. So to access the value stored at the 1st location, use 0, for the 2nd location use 1 and so on. Accessing the values in an array by their position or index is called array indexing. You can perform array indexing by using the name of the array, followed by the required index in square brackets []. For the above example, the below code snippet demonstrates how you can do array indexing\n1console.log(countries[0]); // Prints Russia 2console.log(countries[1]); // Prints Canada 3console.log(countries[2]); // Prints China 4console.log(countries[3]); // Prints United States 5console.log(countries[4]); // Prints Brazil Objects can be used to group information relevant to a single real-life entity in the code. For example, let's say you want to store the details of a person in the code. The below code snippet shows how you can do this using objects and compares it to the alternative.\n1// Approach 1: Without objects 2var name = \u0026#39;John Doe\u0026#39;; 3var age = 45; 4var address = \u0026#39;21 Elm Street, 5201 London, UK\u0026#39; 5 6// Approach 2: With objects 7var person = { 8 \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;John Doe\u0026#39;, 9 \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 45, 10 \u0026#39;address\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;21 Elm Street, 5201 London, UK\u0026#39; 11} 12 13// There are two ways to access the values stored in an object 14// The first is to specify the property you are trying to access between [] 15// This way of accessing properties is called the Bracket notation 16console.log(person[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;]); 17 18// The second is to specify the property you are trying to access using a . 19// This way of accessing properties is called the Dot notation 20console.log(person.age) As can be seen above, holding the data in objects makes it easier to define and access this data.\nOperators If you have variables, you can use them to perform different kinds of operations. To do so, you need operators. Basic\n1+ ‚Äî //Addition 2- ‚Äî //Subtraction 3* ‚Äî Multiplication 4/ ‚Äî Division 5(...) ‚Äî Grouping operator, operations within brackets are executed earlier than those outside 6% ‚Äî Modulus (remainder ) 7++ ‚Äî Increment numbers, i.e. increase the value by 1 8-- ‚Äî Decrement numbers, i.e. decrease the value by 1  Comparison\n== ‚Äî Equal to (e.g. 3 == \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;) === ‚Äî Equal value and equal type (e.g. 3 === 3) != ‚Äî Not equal (e.g. 3 != \u0026quot;4\u0026quot;) !== ‚Äî Not equal value or not equal type (e.g. 3 !== \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;) \u0026gt; ‚Äî Greater than (e.g. 4 \u0026gt; 3) \u0026lt; ‚Äî Less than (e.g. 3 \u0026lt; 4) \u0026gt;= ‚Äî Greater than or equal to (e.g. 3 \u0026gt;= 3) \u0026lt;= ‚Äî Less than or equal to (e.g. 3 \u0026lt;= 3) ? ‚Äî Ternary operator  Logical\n\u0026amp;\u0026amp; ‚Äî Logical and || ‚Äî Logical or ! ‚Äî Logical not   Comments 1/* 2Comments are important because they help other people understand 3what is going on in your code. 4We already used a lot of comments in the examples above. 5Go back and try to identify them ;) 6This is a multi line comment 7*/ 8 9// This is a single line comment If...else statement Let's say you have to ask an input from the user and show a pop-up window which says \u0026quot;Equal to 50\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Less than 50\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Greater than 50\u0026quot; depending on the value entered by the user. This requires making a decision based on the value entered by the user. This is where you can use an if...else statement.\nA simple if statement is shown below. The condition can be a variable or any expression which is a boolean data type. The code inside the curly braces is evaluated only if the value of the boolean expression is true.\n1if (condition) { 2 // code goes here 3} 4 5// Below are some examples of valid Boolean expressions 6x === 50 7x \u0026lt; 50 8x \u0026gt; 50 9x != 50 10 11// Below is a complete if statement with some code 12if (x === 50) { 13 // You can put any code here which should execute if x is equal to 50 14 console.log(\u0026#34;Equal\u0026#34;); 15} If there is a situation where you want to execute some code when the condition is true and some other code when the condition is false, you can use an if...else statement, which is demonstrated below\n1if (x === 50) { 2 // You can put any code here which should execute if x is equal to 50 3 console.log(\u0026#34;Equal\u0026#34;); 4} else { 5 // You can put any code here which should execute if x is not equal to 50 6 console.log(\u0026#34;Not Equal\u0026#34;); 7} If there are multiple different conditions you need to evaluate and execute code accordingly, you can use the if...else if...else construct\n1if (x === 50) { 2 console.log(\u0026#34;Value and type are equal\u0026#34;); 3} else if (x == 50) { 4 console.log(\u0026#34;Value is equal\u0026#34;); 5} else { 6 console.log(\u0026#34;Neither value nor type are equal\u0026#34;); 7} The code snippet below shows how the scenario mentioned earlier can be coded.\n1/* prompt is a function which shows a pop-up asking for user input 2The parameter passed to the function is the message displayed on the pop-up */ 3var userInput = prompt(\u0026#34;Enter a number\u0026#34;); 4 5/* The output from the prompt function is a String 6To convert it to a Number, you can just pass it as a parameter to Number() */ 7var num = Number(userInput); 8 9/* An if statement 10*/ 11if (num === 50) { 12 alert(\u0026#34;Equal to 50\u0026#34;); 13} else if (num \u0026lt; 50) { 14 alert(\u0026#34;Less than 50\u0026#34;); 15} else { 16 alert(\u0026#34;Greater than 50\u0026#34;); 17} Events HTML events are \u0026quot;things\u0026quot; that happen to HTML elements.\nWhen JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can \u0026quot;react\u0026quot; on these events.\nAn HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.\nHere are some examples of HTML events:\n An HTML web page has finished loading An HTML input field was changed An HTML button was clicked  Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.\nJavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.\nYou can specify what code to execute by using the addEventListener method of an element. The below snippet shows how to handle a click event on a button to show a popup. The first parameter to addEventListener is the type of event. Here since we want to respond to someone clicking on the button, the event type is click. The second parameter is the actual code to execute. This could be provided as a function declaration inline or as the name of a function declared elsewhere. The code or function which is called is referred to as the event handler, since it handles the event in some way.\n1\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;show_popup\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Show popup\u0026lt;/input\u0026gt; 1var btn = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;show_popup\u0026#39;); 2btn.addEventListener(\u0026#34;click\u0026#34;, function() { 3 alert(\u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s a popup\u0026#34;); 4}); 5 6// Alternative way of specifying the event handler 7btn.addEventListener(\u0026#34;click\u0026#34;, showPopup); 8 9function showPopup() { 10 alert(\u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s a popup\u0026#34;); 11} Activity Try to create the guessing game mentioned in this link.

We will answer these questions at the beginning of class. (Remember, if you have a question, so does someone else in the class, so please feel free to ask :) ) Review 26/October - Introduction to Python Read through the Python Installation Overview section below. Spend some time thinking about which option may make sense for you. VSCode or PyCharm will give you the most options and would enable you to continue practicing your command line and git/GitHub skills. Try getting set up with at least one of the options, but don't spend more than 1-2 hours on this if you run into a lot of unexpected problems. We will troubleshoot at the beginning of this session as well as in person at the ReDI school on Thursday for those who have issues installing.  Python Installation Overview Google Colab Overview  free, requires a google account (gmail) and an internet connection no need to install Python on your computer, as Colab comes with an interpreter built-in that can run your code easy to create a new document or create a \u0026quot;copy\u0026quot; of assignments that we create can use the UI to save copies to GitHub or to your Google Drive makes it easy to execute and write code in notebook \u0026quot;cells\u0026quot;; it's possible to mix code and text in a readable and clear way notebook-style is very common in the Data Science space, so if you think you may want to go in the direction of data science or analytics, this could be a great option  here's an example iPython Notebook in Colab if you'd like to get a sense of what these are!   can be used for writing Python Notebooks (.ipynb only, no pure .py files) one of the options used in the Intro to Python course with ReDI school recommended if you don't feel as comfortable installing Python on your machine or had difficulties with this, you don't want to work on the command line or use git/GitHub, or you are particularly interested in learning data science/analysis in the future  Setup instructions  Visit Google Colab. You may need to login with your gmail account or else create a Google Account in order to use Google Colab. In the bottom right, click on New Notebook. This will create a new Python Notebook in your Google Drive. Some notes:  You can rename this file by clicking on the name (probably Untitled0) in the top left and renaming this. (See diagram below). (Note) If you want to save this Notebook in GitHub, you can create a repository in GitHub and initialize it with a README or other file. Then, in your Colab notebook, click File \u0026gt; Save Copy to GitHub. You may need to authorize your account (let GitHub know that it's ok for Colab to write to your repositories on your behalf), but then you can select this repository, and Colab will save a copy to it with the current state. If you make changes that you want to commit, you can repeat this process.   In your notebook, click into the cell and write a Python statement of your choice (perhaps, a function to print hello world or add two numbers together). Then, click the play button (or use Shift + Enter) to execute this line of code. After a few seconds, the result of the expression should appear under the cell.  Done! Optionally: check out the Welcome to Colaboratory notebook that Google has provided, and watch the short introductory video in it. This will just give you a sense of what you can do in Colab.  VSCode  free IDE that we have previously used in this class requires you to have installed a version of Python on your machine can be used for writing and executing Python Notebooks (like in Colab) as well as pure Python scripts and modules (.ipynb and .py files) can install extensions to add Python syntax-highlighting and coding tips will require you to continue practicing your command line and git/GitHub skills recommended if you feel comfortable installing Python, want to continue using the command line to navigate your file system and using git/GitHub as you develop your project, or you want to continue deepening your knowledge of one IDE rather than trying out a new platform  Setup Instructions   Download and install Python at this link (latest version -- 3.10.0). Complete all of the installer steps.\n  (Optional) in the installed Python folder, there should be an IDLE program. Double click or run this program, which opens a Python interactive shell. This will execute Python code statements. Try it out by printing something (hint: use the print function)\n  In VSCode, install the following extensions by clicking on the extensions tab on the left, searching for the following extensions, and clicking \u0026quot;Install\u0026quot; (see diagram):\n Python MagicPython Visual Studio IntelliCode Another option: Python Extension Pack which includes all three of the above extensions plus a few more    In VSCode in the View menu in the top left corner, click Command Palette (or use the shortcut Command-Shift-P) which should bring down a dropdown menu. Here, type \u0026quot;Python: Select Interpreter\u0026quot; and click on this option. This should bring up a list of all Python versions installed on your computer -- select 3.10.0, the version you installed.   (Optional) test that this works! Create a new project or a new file with the .py ending (for example: hello_world.py). Have this file output \u0026quot;Hello World!\u0026quot; (hint: use the print function). Click on the green play button in the top right corner to run the code. This should open the terminal in VSCode and print out the output. If you run into errors, try restarting VSCode to make sure all changes were in place, and then if you run into the same issue, Google this error or ask a teacher or peer in class!\n  PyCharm (Community Edition)  Community Edition is free; upgrading to the Professional Edition is not necessary for the purposes of this course an IDE (integrated development environment) designed for Python requires you to have installed a version of Python on your machine built-in awesome features that help you write and execute Python code (function signature help + completion, syntax highlighting) can manage different Python virtual environments for you (different versions of Python, different additional packages specific to projects, etc.) can be used for writing and executing Python Notebooks (like in Colab) as well as pure Python scripts and modules (.ipynb and .py files) will require you to continue practicing your command line and git/GitHub skills one of the options used in the Intro to Python course with ReDI school recommended if you feel comfortable installing Python, want to continue using the command line to navigate your file system and using git/GitHub as you develop your project, or you think you may want to continue learning Python after this course  Setup Instructions   Download and install Python at this link (latest version -- 3.10.0). Complete all of the installer steps.\n  (Optional) in the installed Python folder, there should be an IDLE program. Double click or run this program, which opens a Python interactive shell. This will execute Python code statements. Try it out by printing something (hint: use the print function)\n  In PyCharm, can select different Python interpreters for each project. Since this is our first project, we need to add and setup a first interpreter. (In the future, you can select this interpreter again, or set up a new one in a similar way.)\n  Open PyCharm and click on New Project. Choose a location for the new project; your normal coding folder is a good idea, as this will create a new directory within it.\n  PyCharm will now ask you to configure your interpreter. Click on Previously configured interpreter, then on the three dots to the right of the select. (Note) you can also use PyCharm to create Virtual Environments. This is a more advanced topic and is out of scope for today, but feel free to look into this and reach out if you would like to know more!\n  Select System Installation and select the path to your Python 3.10 installation. Make sure that this is the path to the version of Python you just installed (3.10), not any other version that was already installed on your computer. (Note: the image shows the path to 3.9, but it should say 3.10 for you if you downloaded the latest version of Python.)   Click Ok to finish configuring the Python version\n  PyCharm may have already created a test main.py file for you. (If not, go ahead and create a file like hello_world.py and have it print out hello world or something else!) Then press the green play button in the top right corner to run this code.\n   Class Curriculum    Section content Expected time (mins) Pre - Requirements     Lesson Goals 5 minutes ‚ùå   Check-in on pre-reqs and questions from last class 10-15 minutes Read and attempt installation instructions   Short review/demo of each installation option 20 minutes Read and attempt installation instructions   Break 10 minutes ‚ùå   Troubleshooting installation in groups 5-30 minutes Read and attempt installation instructions   Hands-on Python exercises (in small groups) rest of class ‚ùå   Check-out 5 minutes ‚ùå    0. Lesson Goals  Have a working development environment on Python. Build familiarity with the concepts of data types, functions, and control flow (loops, conditionals) Continue writing code in Python  1. Check-In  What was particularly challenging last class? Are there any remaining questions from last class? Was there anything you found strange or surprising last class? What are you excited to learn more about? Were there any challenges understanding the pre-requisites for today's class?  2. Short review of each installation option  Colab, PyCharm, VSCode We will also take a look at a Python Notebook (.ipynb) vs. normal Python file .py. What is the difference between these two formats? How do we run each of these?  Notebooks are made up of \u0026quot;cells\u0026quot; which allow you to execute blocks of code. Cells can also contain Markdown or text, so these can be useful for demoing information or for storing plots, charts, and doing data analysis. Notebooks are commonly used in the Data Science and Machine Learning fields. .py files are Python files, and can be executed by a Python interpreter via path/to/python/installation filename.py where you replace path/to/python/installation with the path to the location that you installed Python on your machine and filename.py with the name of your Python file. Your interpreter will also look for a main.py in your module or the statement: if __name__ == '__main__': in a file to know where to begin running your code. This is where you can tell the interpreter to start calling your functions.   We will take a look at the IDLE Python terminal that comes with your Python installation and how you can interactively execute lines of code here. (There are other Python terminals that you can install or use, such as ipython.) This can be useful for testing out your logic and syntax as you are writing a longer program as well!  3. Troubleshooting in Groups We will split up into groups based on whether folks have Python installed or are having issues so that we can troubleshoot and get everyone set up as quickly as possible :) We can also continue this during the in-person session if we can't solve these issues quickly enough!\nGroups that are done with installation can start working on the Python problems from the following section.\n4. Hands-on Python Tasks Work in groups to solve the following tasks in your new Python Dev setup. As a group exercise, we expect you to discuss with your group members to solve the problems together. This may mean having one person share their screen and talking through the code you will write together, and making sure you all understand before moving on to the next task. If you do not get through the exercises in class, please keep trying to work through them as homework.\nIf you are already familiar with Python and would like an additional challenge, try to use git to commit and push your work. (That means, create a local and corresponding remote repository, add your Python file to the repo, commit your changes, and push these to the remote repo.)\nThere are a lot of tasks, but they are each fairly short. The goal here is to get more practice with data types and the syntax that we learned from the last session.\nSetup First, let's make sure we have a place to write our Python code. Please follow the setup for your dev environment.\nGoogle Colab Create a new notebook. For each task, we recommend creating a new cell (block within the Colab notebook) and writing your code there. Make sure to evaluate the code in the cell (click the play button, or hit the keys: Shift-Enter or Ctrl-Enter) to check the outputs.\nVSCode Create and save a new file (File \u0026gt; New File) -- you can call it something like python_exercises_nov2.py or whatever else you would like, but make sure it has the .py file extension. Make sure your Python interpreter is configured properly (according to the installation instructions). Enter the following line into your file: print('hello'). Then, try to find the play button in the top right corner and press that, or else right click somewhere within the file and select Run Python File in Terminal. Make sure you can see the output 'hello' in the terminal at the bottom.\nPyCharm You can use the project that you set up as part of installing PyCharm or create a new project, depending on how you would like to organize your work. Create a new file (File \u0026gt; New, or right-clicking on the left-hand bar and selecting New \u0026gt; File) -- you can call it something like python_exercises_nov2.py or whatever else you would like, but make sure it has the .py file extension. Enter the following line into your file: print('hello'). Then, right click on the file tab and select Run 'YOUR_FILE_NAME'. Make sure you can see the output 'hello' in the terminal at the bottom. After the first time, you can also simply click the green play button in the top right corner (and make sure the drop-down next to this shows the file name you want to run).\nBackup Option If your setup is not yet working properly, you can also use the IDLE terminal that comes with the Python installation or else the Python playground from last class.\nTask 0 - Comments Comments are lines of code that Python will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.\nThere are two ways to write comments in Python:\nUsing # will tell Python to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:\n1# This is an in-line comment. You can also have comments that span multiple lines which are done with three single or double quotes to start and 3 to end.\n1\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; 2This is a mutiline comment 3\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code‚Äîboth for others and for your future self.\nFor each of the following tasks, add a comment about your code that states which task you are working on (ex. # Code for task 12). Once you have completed a task, you can comment out the printed value from that section, so that you do not continue to see the output of all the previous tasks each time. (There isn't a real output for this task!)\nTask 1 - Declare variables Last class, we went over several Python data types. A \u0026quot;data type\u0026quot; describes the quality or structure of a piece of information. Some of the data types that we saw last class include:\n int for integers (1,0,-4), str for strings ('asdf', 'b', '234'), float for floating point numbers (1.2, 3.44444, 6.2837), bool for booleans (True, False), list for lists ([1,2,3], ['qw45', 134]),  For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as \u0026quot;12\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dog\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;123 cats\u0026quot;, which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.\nVariables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a \u0026quot;label\u0026quot; to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the data types may be stored in a variable, and the value of a variable can be modified.\nWe can create a new Python variable by assigning a value to a label, using the = assignment operator.\n1my_name = \u0026#34;tess\u0026#34;; creates a variable called my_name. A variable name can be composed of characters, numbers, and the _ underscore character. It can't start with a number.\nCreate a variable called our_class and assign it the value \u0026quot;Intro to CS\u0026quot;. Print the value of this variable to make sure that it has been set to Intro to CS.\nTask 2 - Assign the value of one variable to another After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator. Here's an example:\n1my_var = \u0026#39;asdf\u0026#39; 2my_num = my_var 3print(my_num) 4# outputs \u0026#39;asdf\u0026#39; Create a variable a and assign it to the value of 5. Assign the contents of a to a new variable, b. Print the values of a and b and make sure these are the same.\nTask 3 - Adding  Create a variable c and assign it to the value of two integers added together (i.e. 2 + 4). Print c and make sure that this is equal to the sum of the two numbers you have added together. Print the sum of c and 2. Using the variable a (value = 5) from Task 2, print the sum of a and c. Increment (increase) the value of c by 2.  Hint: you can increment the value of a variable by using either the += operator (i.e. my_var += 5) or by reassigning the variable (i.e. my_var = my_var + 5).\nTask 4 - Subtracting  Create a variable d and assign it to the value of an integer subtracted from another (i.e. 4 - 3). Print d and make sure that this is equal to the difference of the two numbers. Print the expression subtracting d from a. Decrement (decrease) the value of d by 2.  Hint: just like with +=, you can decrement by using the -= operator or by reassigning the variable (i.e. my_var = my_var - 5).\nTask 5 - Multiplying  Create a variable e and assign it to the value of an integer multiplied by another (i.e. 3 * 9). Print e and make sure that this is equal to the product of the two numbers you have multiplied. Print the expression multiplying e with a. Multiply the value of e by 2.  Hint: just like with -=, you can multiply the value of a variable by using the *= operator or by reassigning the variable (i.e. my_var = my_var * 5).\nTask 6 - Dividing  Create a variable f and assign it to the value of a number divided by another (i.e. 3 / 9). Print f and make sure that this is equal to the quotient (result of the division). Print the expression dividing f by a. Divide the value of f by 2.  Hint: just like with *=, you can multiply the value of a variable by using the /= operator or by reassigning the variable (i.e. my_var = my_var / 5).\nNote that there are multiple \u0026quot;types\u0026quot; of division. In Python, / (as used above) divides as we normally think of division and can return a floating point value. There is a second operator, //, that performs what is called \u0026quot;integer division\u0026quot; which means that it discards the remainder (i.e. no value after the decimal point).\nTask 7 - Modulo (remainder) The modulo (%) or remainder operator gives the remainder of the division of two numbers. Example:\n15 % 2 = 1 because 22 * 2 = 4 35 - 4 = 1 (Remainder) This can be useful to check, among other things, whether a number is even or odd, by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2:\n117 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd) 248 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even) Copy the following code and replace VALUE_HERE with an integer so that the value of mod_output is equal to 3.\n1a = VALUE_HERE 2mod_output = 9 % a 3print(mod_output) Task 8 - String variables Recall that a string is a series of zero or more characters that are enclosed in either single or double quotes, or triple quotes (the same as with multiline comments). Valid strings in Python include:\n1\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # empty string 2\u0026#34;\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;\u0026#34; 3\u0026#39;adf\u0026#39; 4\u0026#39;\u0026#34;asdf\u0026#34;\u0026#39; 5\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;asdf\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; In Python, you can \u0026quot;concatenate\u0026quot;, or join, two strings together using the + operator. In Python, 'hello' + ' world' would equal 'hello world'.\n Create two new string variables: my_first_name and my_last_name and assign them to the values of your first and last name. Print out the value of each variable to confirm this. Concatenate the two string variables and print this result. Additionally, try to add a space between the two. (Hint: you can concatenate more than one string in an expression, like: 'hello' + ',' + 'world'). Create a new variable called my_fullname and set this to the value of my_first_name concatenated with a space and then my_last_name (as in the exercise directly above this). Recall the += operator that we used to increment a variable. This can also be used to concatenate a string onto the end of a string variable. Try this operator out by adding the line: my_first_name += ' is awesome' and printing out my_first_name. Is this value what you expected?  Task 9 - String lengths In Python, you can find the length of a String value by writing using the built-in len function. Example:\n1len(\u0026#34;redi\u0026#34;) 2# outputs 4 3len(\u0026#39;hello, world\u0026#39;) 4# outputs 12  Copy the following snippet into your file, and then print the lengths of each of the following variables:  1empty = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; 2language = \u0026#34;Python\u0026#34; 3sentence = \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m a really long sentence\u0026#34;  Write a line of code that defines the variable total_length as the sum of the lengths of all three variables above.  Task 10 - Strings as iterables Bracket notation, or \u0026quot;array indexing\u0026quot; is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string. (This also works for lists and other ordered iterables). Most modern programming languages, like Python, don't start counting at 1 like humans do, but instead start at 0. This is referred to as \u0026quot;zero-indexing\u0026quot;.\nFor example, the character at the index 0 in the word Hello is H. So if word = \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;, you can get the value of the first letter of this string by using: word[0].\nIn Python, you can also use negative numbers to index backwards into a word. For example, word[-1] will get you the last letter in the word.\n Use bracket notation to find the first character in sentence from task 9, and print this out. Use bracket notation and the len operator to find the last letter in the word, and print this out. (Hint: the last index is equal to the length of the word - 1 (because of zero-indexing)). Use the negative number indexing to find and print the second to last letter in sentence.  Task 11 - Slicing strings You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve a part of the string (sometimes referred to as a \u0026quot;substring\u0026quot;). Here are some examples (note: leaving the index off before or after the : is shorthand for the start and end of the word):\n1word = \u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34; 2word[1:2] # outputs: \u0026#34;e\u0026#34; 3word[0:3] # outputs: \u0026#34;Hel\u0026#34;; equivalent to word[:3] 4word[:] # outputs: \u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34; 5word[3:6] # outputs: \u0026#34;lo!\u0026#34;; equivalent to word[3:] 6word[2:-2] # outputs: \u0026#34;ll\u0026#34;; equivalent to word[2:len(word) - 2]  Using the variable sentence from task 9, sentence = \u0026quot;I'm a really long sentence\u0026quot;, create a new variable only_really that contains only the word really in the sentence, and print the value of this variable. Using the variable sentence again, create a new variable called first_letters that contains the first 4 letters of sentence.  Task 12 - Lists Lists are one of the more complex Python data types. Lists hold other data types like strings, integers, floats, and even lists. Each list item has an index, like strings. The index starts from 0. Just as with strings, the len function also gives you the length of a list. Also like strings, you can slice a list, which means to get some part of the overall list. Here are some examples to illustrate this:\n1# creating some lists 2fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;] 3stuff = [12, \u0026#39;asdf\u0026#39;, 123.013, [1,2,3]] 4 5# here\u0026#39;s the indexing 6fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;] 7# 0 1 2 8# like strings, lists can also use negative indexing 9fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;] 10# -3 -2 -1 11 12# get the length of the list 13len(fruits) 14# outputs: 3 15 16# slice a list 17fruits[:2] 18# outputs: [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;] 19fruits[1:3] 20# outputs: [\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;]  Create a list with the first names of your breakout room group, and assign this to the variable first_names. Print the list. Print out the value of the second name in first_names. (Hint: use the bracket notation asa with strings.) Print the length of the list of names. Create a slice of the list containing the first two names and print this slice.  Task 13 - Appending and removing elements from a list There are several methods that you can use with lists. The .append() method adds an item to a list, while the .remove() method removes an item from the list:\n1fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;] 2fruits.append(\u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;) 3# value of fruits is now: [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;] 4fruits.remove(\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;) 5# value of fruits is now: [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]  Using the list of your names (first_names), add one name and print the list. Using the list of your names (first_names), remove one name and print the list.  Task 14 - Dictionaries Dictionaries are a Python data structure. While lists allow you to create ordered collections of values, dictionaries allow you to create collections of key / value pairs. An analogy for a dictionary is a telephone book: you can look up a telephone number (value) by a person's name (key).\nHere are some dictionary examples:\n1empty_dict = dict() 2dog = { \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Roger\u0026#39; } 3# assign the value: 8 to the key: \u0026#39;age\u0026#39; 4dog[\u0026#39;age\u0026#39;] = 8 5# the dog dictionary now looks like: { \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Roger\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 8 } 6 7# access a value by a key 8dog[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] 9# outputs: \u0026#39;Roger\u0026#39; Dictionaries also contain the .keys(), .values(), and .items() methods which return iterables (like lists) of these values:\n1list(dog.keys()) 2# outputs: [\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;] 3list(dog.values()) 4# outputs: [\u0026#39;Roger\u0026#39;, 8] 5list(dog.items()) 6# outputs: [(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Roger\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;age\u0026#39;, 8)]  Create a dictionary called person with the keys first_name amd last_name and give them some values. Print out the dictionary. In the person dictionary, assign the job key to the value programmer, and print out the dictionary. Access and print out the value of the first_name key in the person dictionary. Print out the keys, values, and items in the person dictionary.  Task 15 - Booleans Booleans may only be one of two values: True or False. These are like on-off switches, where True is on and False is off. These states are mutually exclusive -- a condition can only be either True or False but not both. You can use the not keyword to \u0026quot;flip the switch\u0026quot; of the boolean value.\n1val1 = True 2val2 = not True 3print(val2) 4# outputs: False  Create a variable called boolean_var and set it to False. Print the value of the opposite of boolean_var (using not).  Task 16 - Comparisons There are many comparison operators in Python. All of these operators return a boolean True or False value. Here are some of these operators:\n ==: equality operator: compares two values and returns True if they're equivalent or False if they are not !=: inequality operator: opposite of equality, returns True if two values are not equivalent and False if they are \u0026gt;: greater than operator: returns True if the left side is greater than the right side and False if not \u0026lt;: less than operator: returns True if the left side is less than the right side and False if not  Note that you can assign a boolean expression to a variable:\n1a = 1 \u0026gt; 2 2print(a) 3# outputs: False Assign these examples to variables and print them out:\n 1 == 1 1 == '1' 2 != '2' 2 \u0026lt; 4 2 \u0026gt; 3 1 != True 0 != False  Were any of these results surprising?\nTask 17 - Control Flow When you're dealing with booleans, and expressions that return a boolean in particular, we can execute different code depending on their True or False values, using if, elif, and else statements. Pay attention to the indentation and white space in Python, as this is very important! Indented blocks \u0026quot;belong\u0026quot; to the overhanging lines above them; you can think of this as \u0026quot;stepping into\u0026quot; indented blocks if conditions evaluate to true.\nThis is a conditional statement: if CONDITION: means: \u0026quot;if CONDITION evaluates to True, then execute the indented code that follows directly after the statement\u0026quot;\nHere's an example for if...else:\n1if CONDITION_A: 2 STATEMENT_A 3else: 4 STATEMENT_B In this example, \u0026quot;if CONDITION_A evaluates to True, then execute STATEMENT_A. Otherwise (if CONDITION_A evaluates to False), then execute STATEMENT_B.\nAnd for if...elif...else:\n1if CONDITION_A: 2 STATEMENT_A 3elif CONDITION_B: 4 STATEMENT_B 5else: 6 STATEMENT_C (Note: elif stands for \u0026quot;else if\u0026quot;, and you can have as many of these as you want in between the beginning if and ending else statements.)\nIn this example, \u0026quot;if CONDITION_A evaluates to True, then execute STATEMENT_A only. Otherwise (if CONDITION_A evaluates to False), then check if CONDITION_B evaluates to True and if so, execute STATEMENT_B only. If both CONDITION_A and CONDITION_B evaluate to False, then execute STATEMENT_C. Note that here, we are only ever execute one of the STATEMENT_'s, even if multiple conditions evaluate to True.\n Use the definition: my_list = [1, 2, 3]. Create an if statement that checks if the last value of the list is equal to 3 and if so, prints \u0026quot;the condition was true\u0026quot;. Building off of the above exercise, make the condition false (so that \u0026quot;the condition was true\u0026quot; no longer prints). Now, add an else clause that prints \u0026quot;the condition was false\u0026quot;. Now, add an elif condition that checks if the length of the list is equal to 3 and if so, prints \u0026quot;the elif condition is true\u0026quot;.  Task 18 - Functions A function lets us create a set of instructions that we can run when needed. Functions are essential in Python and in many other programming languages. They help us create meaningful programs, because they allow us to decompose a program into manageable parts, and they promote readability and code reuse.\nHere is an example function:\n1def greet(name): 2 print(\u0026#39;Hello,\u0026#39;, name) This is the function definition. There is a def keyword, so that the Python interpreter knows that this is a function definition, function name (greet), arguments (name in this case), and a body (the set of instructions, which is the part that follows the colon and is indented one level on the left).\nTo run this function, we must call it. This is the syntax to call the function: greet('Rami') We can execute this function as many times as we want to.\nThe name of the function, hello, is very important. It should be descriptive, so anyone calling it can imagine what the function does.\n Write a function called was_it_sunny that takes in a boolean argument it_was, that prints \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot; if the parameter value was True and \u0026quot;no\u0026quot; otherwise. Call this function twice, once with the value True and once with False, and print the outputs of these calls. Write a function that takes in 3 values and returns a list containing those three values.

What exercises were the most challenging? (Respond in the chat)  2. for and while loops Loops are a tool that help us execute a block of code a specified amount of times or based on a condition. In Python, there are two loops: for and while loops.\nwhile loops while loops allow us to execute a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to True.\nPlease excuse the ugly diagram :)\nSyntax:\n1while condition: 2 # do things Examples:\n1# This is called an \u0026#34;infinite loop\u0026#34; since the condition is always True!! 2while True: 3 print(\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m an infinite loop! I won\u0026#39;t stop unless I\u0026#39;m forced to!\u0026#34;) 1count = 0 2while count \u0026lt; 10: 3 print(\u0026#34;hello #\u0026#34;, count) 4 # increment the value of `count` 5 count += 1 6 # outputs: 7 # hello # 0 8 # hello # 1 9 # hello # 2 10 # hello # 3 11 # hello # 4 12 # hello # 5 13 # hello # 6 14 # hello # 7 15 # hello # 8 16 # hello # 9 17 Check-in question: can someone explain what's going on in each of these examples?\nfor loops for loops provide a way to go through each value (or set of values) in an iterable (e.g. a list, string, dictionary, etc.) and execute a block of code that uses that value.\nSyntax:\n1for variable(s) in iterable: 2 # do things Examples: (feel free to try executing these in your IDLE terminal, notebook cell (in Colab), VSCode, or PyCharm :)\n1for num in [1, 2, 3]: 2 print(num) 3 # outputs: 4 # 1 5 # 2 6 # 3 1for letter in \u0026#39;word\u0026#39;: 2 new_word = letter + \u0026#39;!!\u0026#39; 3 print(new_word) 4 # outputs: 5 # w!! 6 # o!! 7 # r!! 8 # d!! 1# python 2for num, letter in [(1, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;), (2, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;)]: 3 # Here, we convert number to string using `str` before concatenating with another string 4 print(str(num) + letter) 5 # outputs: 6 # 1a 7 # 2b 8 With for loops, it can also be useful to use the range operator in Python which creates an iterable of numbers. The syntax of this is range(start, end, step), but you will also see this as just range(start, end) or range(end) (in this last case, the start is assumed to be 0). Note that the end value is not included (in other words, \u0026quot;numbers starting with start up until (not through) end\u0026quot;). Here are some examples:\n1for i in range(3): 2 print(i) 3 # outputs: 4 # 0 5 # 1 6 # 2 1list(range(1, 4)) # we can create a list out of a `range` 2# [1, 2, 3] 1list(range(-1, 9, 3)) # here, the step (space between values) is 3 2# [-1, 2, 5, 8] 3. Hands-on Python Tasks Work in groups to solve the following tasks in your Python Dev setup. As a group exercise, we expect you to discuss with your group members to solve the problems together. This may mean having one person share their screen and talking through the code you will write together, and making sure you all understand before moving on to the next task. You are not expected to get through all of these in class, and they range from easier to harder. We will continue working on these exercises in the next session as well.\nTo build on the skills that we have learned earlier in the semester, if working in VSCode or PyCharm, please create a new repository and commit your changes as you go. You can check out the reference sheets to help remember the necessary git and command line commands. Click here for the cheat sheet\nOptionally, you may send in a link to a GitHub repository with your solutions (if working in VSCode or PyCharm) or share your notebook (if working in Colab) if you would like feedback on your work :)\nNote: if you are writing in Colab or a Python Notebook, then try to keep each task in a separate code cell. If you are writing in a pure Python file, consider wrapping each task in a function (that is, write a function to solve the task) and call these functions in the if __name__ == '__main__': block to test out your code. This might look something like:\n1# in your file: 2def task_n(a, b): 3 # code to solve task 1 4 ... 5 6 return answer_to_task_n 7 8if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 9 print(task_n(1, 2)) # prints output of task_n 10 Note: it can be helpful to test out your functions by making sure that the functions return what you expect for a few different inputs. Make sure to try out a variety of inputs including some \u0026quot;edge cases\u0026quot;, or cases that are trickier and can cause problems. These edge cases often have to do with \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; or empty-inputs. (Optional): In Python, you can also write assert statements, where you would state what you believe the function to output to be, and it fails if this is not the case.\nLet's use an example task 0 to illustrate all the points above.\nTask 0 (warmup) Write a function called add_10 that takes in an integer, adds 10, and returns this value. Test out these steps and make sure you feel comfortable with the process. The following tasks won't have a walk through, but you should follow the same rough process.\nSteps:\n Write out your function skeleton, or the empty function with the name and parameters. (Note: n is commonly used to denote a number, but you can also write more descriptive variable names):  1def add_10(n): 2 # TODO: add logic to add 10 3 return \u0026#34;Not implemented\u0026#34; Let's call this function somewhere so we can see what it's outputting. In a .py file:  1if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 2 # the text is not required, but it helps me see what I called to get the output 3 print(\u0026#34;add_10(3): \u0026#34;, add_10(3)) # for now, this returns \u0026#34;add_10(3): Not implemented\u0026#34; 4 Let's add in some logic and check the values that it is outputting. If these values don't match your expectations (which often happens in programming), then take another look and try to understand what's going wrong. You can add print statements in your code as well to tell you what the values of different variables and conditions are while you are running your code. You should feel encouraged to look things up when you run into issues as well.  1def add_10(n): 2 return n + 10 3 4if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 5 print(\u0026#34;add_10(3): \u0026#34;, add_10(3)) # this should now print \u0026#34;add_10(3): 13\u0026#34; 6 print(\u0026#34;add_10(-10): \u0026#34;, add_10(-10)) # this should now print \u0026#34;add_10(-10): 0\u0026#34; 7 Optional: you can also use assert statements to confirm your expectations. This is a way of writing simple \u0026quot;test cases\u0026quot; to make sure your logic works. This looks something like:  1def add_10(n): 2 return n + 10 3 4if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 5 assert add_10(3) == 13 6 assert add_10(-10) == 0 7 assert add_10(0) == 10 8 What happens if the assert statement is wrong? (Hint: try out something like assert add_10(3) == 5 which we expect to fail and see what happens.)\nYou can also add this in to a test function to organize your code:\n1def add_10(n): 2 return n + 10 3 4def test_add_10(): 5 assert add_10(3) == 13 6 assert add_10(-10) == 0 7 assert add_10(0) == 10 8 9 10if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: 11 test_add_10() # expect no output if all assertions passed 12 Task 1 Write a function called longer_string that takes in two strings and returns the longer of the two. If they are the same length, return the first string.\nTask 2 Write a function called is_odd that takes in an integer and returns True if the number is odd and False otherwise.\nHint: look up (Google) what the modulo (%) operator in Python is and use it to determine if a number is odd or even.  Task 3 (parts 1, 2) Write a function called hello_world_n that takes in an integer n and prints \u0026quot;Hello, world!\u0026quot; n times.\n do this using a for loop do this using a while loop  Task 4 Write a function called sum_list that takes in a list of integers (i.e. [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]) and returns the sum of them. Do not use the sum function in your logic, but you can use this to test your logic! (Hint: assert sum(lst) == ...)\nTask 5 Write a function that takes in a list of integers (i.e. [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]) and prints the value of each element greater than 4. For example:\n  input: [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]\n1# output: 2# 10 3# 5   input: [4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4]\n1# output: 2# 5 3# 6 4# 6 5# 5   input: [4, 3, 2, 1]\n1# no output   Optional Challenge: change your function to take in a second parameter, min_val. Now, print all values in the list greater than this value.\nExample input: [4, 3, 2, 1], 2\n1 # output: 2 # 4 3 # 3   (Challenge) Task 6 (parts 1, 2) Note: this one is optional and meant to be challenging! :)\nLike with task 4, do not use the Python function max in your function, but you can use this to test it out!\n Write a function that takes in a list of integers (i.e. [3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]) and returns largest value in the list. Write a function that takes in a list of strings (i.e. ['a', 'asdf', '']) and returns the longest string in the list.  (Challenge) Task 7 (parts 1, 2, 3) Note: this one is optional and meant to be challenging! :)\n  Write a function that takes in an integer and prints all numbers below it that are divisible by 3. (Hint: recall Task 2 -- how can you check if a number is divisible by 3?)\nExample input: 12\n1# output: 2# 0 3# 3 4# 6 5# 9    Modify the function to return how many numbers are divisible by 3, in addition to printing each number. (i.e. the returned value for the example input above would be 4 (0, 3, 6, 9)).\n  Modify this function to make it general -- if the function takes in n and k, find out how many numbers less than n are divisible by k.\nExample input: 8, 2\n1# output: 2# 0 3# 2 4# 4 5# 6 6# returns 4   Additional Resources  W3 schools Python while loops W3 schools Python for loops Tutorialspoint loops in Python additional practice problems on loops and conditions (note: some are challenging!) additional practice problems (note: challenging!)

Command Line cheat sheet Go through the following commands and operators to remind yourself what each of them does, and when you would use them.\nRemember that you can look up what a command does by using the man (manual-pages) command on Mac and Linux, or help command on Windows cmd. For example: man echo would give you information on what the echo command does and how to use it.     command what it does     echo print some text   pwd print working directory (print the path to where I currently am in the file system)   ls list the contents of the directory   cd change directory (this moves you, the viewer of the terminal, to a new location in the file system)   cat print the contents of the file   cp copy a file (note: to copy a directory you probably need to add an option (like -r) to copy a directory)   mv move a file or directory to a new location (note: this can also be useful for changing the name of a file/directory)   mkdir make a directory   touch create a new file   rm delete a file (note: to delete a directory, add the option -r or -d)   \u0026gt; the redirection operator (X \u0026gt; Y will send the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will overwrite the existing file.)    1. Fork and clone repository First, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. (If you don't already have a designated folder for class materials, create a directory for this and navigate into it.) Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of another repository, usually one that is stored on a remote server like GitHub.\nFork this repository. In the top right corner, click Fork. You may be prompted with a question like \u0026quot;Where should we fork this repository to?\u0026quot; If so, click your GitHub username; this will create a copy of the repository to your account.\nYou should then be automatically taken to the main page of this repository. On the upper right side, click Code (in green) and copy the HTTPS link. Then in your terminal run git clone \u0026lt;link-you-copied\u0026gt;. For example, this should look something like the following (with github-username replaced with your own github username):\n1git clone https://github.com/github-username/intro-to-cs-git-review.git Check that this directory now exists. (Hint: list the contents of the directory you are in, and make sure you see the cloned folder.)\nMove into that directory:\n1cd intro-to-cs-git-review Check the status of the git repository:\n1git status You should see output something like:\n1On branch main 2Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/main\u0026#39;. 3 4nothing to commit, working tree clean If so, great! You have successfully forked and cloned this repository. If not, check in with someone in your group or one of the teachers to help before moving on to the next steps.\n2. Checkout a new branch One of the great things about Git is being able to work on the same repository as others at the same time. A typical way of doing this when working on a project is by creating and checking out a new branch (via git checkout -b \u0026lt;branch-name\u0026gt;), making changes and committing your work, and pushing this work to your separate branch. Once you are ready to publish your changes to the main branch, you can create a pull request (PR) to have others review your changes and merge them to the main branch.\nEven though you are working on your own repository alone (since you forked, this is your own repository), let's practice creating a new branch so we can make some changes there and eventually merge this back to the main branch. Let's call this branch \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch (leave out the \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, for example, for me, I would call the branch eelanagaraj/test-branch):\n1git checkout -b \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch Check the status of the repository again before moving on to the next step, and make sure that you are on the correct branch. (Hint: run git status which displays the branch you are on, and make sure this is what you expect.)\n3. Making and committing some changes This activity should remind you a bit of the directory \u0026quot;maze\u0026quot; exploration activity that we did with Erg√ºn last week.\nLet's go ahead and explore the contents of this repository. For these tasks, feel free to look at your notes, the cheat sheet above, or ask each other for help if you're not sure how to complete a task :)\n  Print your current directory, to double check that you are in the right place :) The end of the path should be the name of the cloned repository.\n  Check what files and directories are present in this repository.\n  Print the contents of the README.md file. Now, compare the output in your terminal to the README displayed on the original remote repository. (Note: the README.md file will be displayed by default on your remote repository page!)\n  Move into the some-files directory. What files are in this repository?\n  Check the contents of each of the files in this folder (some-files). Delete the file that is empty (has no contents).\n  Check the status of the repository via git status. If you do not see something that says you deleted a file, please ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on.\n  Stage the changes by running git add . and check the status again to make sure the changes have shown up in your staging area.\n  Create a commit now to \u0026quot;save\u0026quot; your changes--in this case, the deleted file. Try to leave a helpful commit message like below, replacing  with the file you deleted:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Deleted file \u0026lt;name-of-file\u0026gt;\u0026#34;   Check that the commit was successful by checking the status of the repository (git status) and checking the log (git log). You should see the commit message that you added at the top of the log, in addition to some previous commits from before you cloned the repository.\n  One of the non-empty files has the contents: Hello, I'm a file! What's your name?. Modify this file that answers the question with your name (or one of your choosing)! So far, we have used: echo \u0026quot;text\u0026quot; \u0026gt; file to add content to a file, but this will overwrite the file with the new contents. Instead, let's append to the file using the following command (replacing \u0026lt;file.txt\u0026gt; with the file you want to write to):\n1echo \u0026#34;My name is ___\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file.txt\u0026gt; You can also open this file in a text editor (like Sublime, Microsoft Word, Notepad, etc.) and modify it there and save your changes!\n  Check the git status again. Can you tell that a file has been modified? If not, ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on. If so, in the same way as above, add these changes to your staging area and create another commit with a descriptive message of your choice. Check that this commit appears in the log as well.\n  Let's go ahead and push these commits so far to the remote repository. Run the following, replacing \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; with the branch you are working on (if you forget what it is called, you can run git status or git branch and copy the branch name from there!):\n  1git push origin \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt;  Navigate out of the some-files directory, so you are back in the root of the repository. Display the contents of the files there. One of the files seems to be out of place; move this file to the some-files directory. Check that this file is now in the proper place by listing the contents of the directory some-files. Check the status of the repository again (git status). Notice that it thinks the file was deleted from the repository, but that there is now a new \u0026quot;untracked file\u0026quot; of the same name in some-files! Let's now add all of the files to the staging area and check the status of the repository again. What does it look like now? Let's commit these staged changes and check the log again to make sure they appeared. In the root of the repository, go ahead and delete the delete-me directory. (Hint: what option do you need to include to remove a directory?). Add, commit, and push these changes.  4. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub As we did at the end of last class, let's create a pull request to merge this test-branch to main.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch: on the left side, there should be a button with main and a down arrow -- click this and select your branch. At the top, if there is an option to \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot;, click that, otherwise click on the \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot; tab and then \u0026quot;New pull request\u0026quot;.\nSince this is a forked branch, we are given the option of submitting a pull request against the original repository that we forked from (listed under base repository). This is often how you can contribute to open source projects -- by forking the repository, making your changes, and then submitting a PR against the original repo for the maintainers of the project to accept or reject.\nFor now, let's just PR within the fork, so change the base repository to be the forked repo. (The base repository and head repository should match, but the base branch should be main).\nAssign someone in your group and one of the teachers to review your pull request.\nTake a moment to review any PRs you were tagged on.\n5. [Optional] Advanced Git practice This is a section for if you are done with the earlier sections and want to try some new git commands out. This is completely optional and more complicated than the previous sections! Remember, you can play around with this repo as much as you want; use it to create new scenarios and test out Git commands to understand what they do. This is a toy repository, and you can always clone a fresh copy (first part of the activity) to restart from scratch, so there is low risk here :)\nFirst, we can use the git reset command to undo changes that we have made.\n Check that you are still on \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/test-branch. Then, checkout a new branch \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/undo-changes, replacing \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt; with your GitHub username. Look at the git log, which should include all of the commits we made in the previous section. Let's say that we now want to \u0026quot;undo\u0026quot; the changes that we made in the last commit, deleting the delete-me folder. We realized after pushing this change that we actually want to keep this folder. Find and copy the commit hash (looks like a long string of letters and numbers, something like: 6ff15394c57d1d105482efd9359d7a061995fedc) of the commit right before this in the commit log. Let's now \u0026quot;reset\u0026quot; the state of the repository to this commit, right before we committed the change to delete the directory, replacing \u0026lt;commit-hash\u0026gt; with the hash from your commit log:  1git reset --hard \u0026lt;commit-hash\u0026gt;  Check the git status of your directory and the git log now. What is the most recent commit in the commit log now? Check the contents of the repository. Is the delete-me folder present or not? Check the contents of the delete-me folder. Feel free to try resetting the repository to different states (different commit hashes) and exploring a bit. Once you are done, you can checkout (get back onto) the main or test-branch from the earlier section and deleting the branch you just created:  1git checkout main 2git branch -D \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/undo-changes If you still have time and want to continue playing around with Git, try to merge two branches that have made changes on the same file. You can see how Git tries to do this automatically and you may have to \u0026quot;resolve merge conflicts\u0026quot; if Git is not able to automatically merge the changes. To create a situation like this:\n Create two branches from the same \u0026quot;base\u0026quot; and checkout one of them. Remember, replace \u0026lt;new-branch-1\u0026gt; nd \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt; with branch names of your choice. (Bonus: look up how to do this via the git branch command instead of git checkout -b): 1git checkout -b \u0026lt;new-branch-1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base-branch\u0026gt; 2git checkout -b \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;base-branch\u0026gt;  Modify and commit to a.txt on  Make a different change to the same file, a.txt on  Try to merge one branch into the other by checkout out  and then running git merge \u0026lt;new-branch-2\u0026gt;. Did you get any merge conflicts? See what the contents of file a.txt are. Try to fix any merge conflicts and commit this merge. Check the log to see what the merge commit looks like.

We will do this both via the command line using the commands listed in the cheat sheet below and then using the GUI (Graphical User Interface). Please refer to this cheat sheet when working through the exercises in groups later!\nCommand Line cheat sheet Remember that you can look up what a command does by using the man (manual-pages) command on Mac and Linux, or help command on Windows cmd.

You may use an absolute file path or a relative path where . is the current working directory and .. is the parent directory.   ls list the contents of the directory   mkdir make a directory   touch create a new file   rm delete a file (note: to delete a directory, add the option -r or -d)   cp copy a file (note: to copy a directory you probably need to add an option (like -r))   mv move a file or directory to a new location (note: this can also be useful for changing the name of a file/directory)   echo print some text; often used in conjunction with other commands   cat print the contents of the file   \u0026gt; this is an operator: X \u0026gt; Y will redirect (send) the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will overwrite the existing file.   \u0026gt;\u0026gt; this is an operator similar to the above: X \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Y will send the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will append to the existing file.    Quick overview of package managers  Packages are collections of files that are bundled together and can be installed and removed as a group\nPackage managers allow you to:\n keep track of what software is installed easily install new software upgrade existing software to newer versions remove or uninstall software.  There are different package managers available for different Operating Systems and Distributions. Here are some examples:\n  MacOS: homebrew, AppStore\n  Windows: PackageManagement, Chocalatey...\n   Linux: yum, apt-get, zypper\n   Tasks for group work Work through the tasks with your partner/group. We recommend that one of you shares your screen and you discuss as a group how to proceed with each of the tasks. Each group member should be following along. It is totally fine if you don't complete all the tasks; make sure you understand how to do each task and ask questions if anything does not make sense! Complete any remaining tasks for homework.\n0. Open a terminal window Open a terminal window or Repl, where you can practice using the command line.\nOn Mac, you can do this by searching for \u0026quot;Terminal\u0026quot; in your Applications folder or using the keyboard shortcut \u0026quot;Command + Space\u0026quot; and then typing in \u0026quot;Terminal\u0026quot;.\nOn Windows, open Cmder if you installed this as part of the prerequisites, or if you installed the Linux subsystem for windows, you can run WSL or follow the instructions described in the video. Alternatively, you can use Cygwin or the gitbash shell to practice Linux commands, or if nothing is available or working on your machine, please use Repl for today.\nIf you are running into any challenges with this, reach out to one of the teachers.\n1. Move to the parent directory and back  Print your working directory Move into the parent directory, if there is one. Move back into the directory you came from.  Hint: if your original working directory path looked something like folder1/folder2/folder3, then for this task, you want to move to folder1/folder2 and then back to folder1/folder2/folder3.\n2. Create a redi folder Let's create a folder to store the work from this session.\n Navigate to the place where you would like this folder to be located. The current working directory is fine, but you can also navigate to your desktop or another folder where you keep course work. Create a new directory (folder) titled redi-2021-09-16 Move into this new directory and print your working directory. Double check that your working directory now includes redi-2021-09-16.  3. Create some files Now let's create some files to go in this new directory.\n  Create an empty file called \u0026quot;test1.txt\u0026quot; using the touch command.\n  Create a second file called \u0026quot;hello.txt\u0026quot; which contains the phrase: \u0026quot;hello, my name is YOUR_NAME_HERE!\u0026quot;. (Replace YOUR_NAME_HERE with your name :)) Hint: use the echo command and the \u0026gt; operator to do this.\n  List the files that are in the directory, and make sure that it looks something like:\n1test1.txt hello.txt   Append the line \u0026quot;How are you doing?\u0026quot; to the file \u0026quot;hello.txt\u0026quot;\n  Print the contents of the file and make sure that it looks something like:\n1hello! my name is YOUR_NAME_HERE! 2How are you doing?   4. Move these files into a new directory Let's organize the directory that we are in by putting some of the files in a new location.\n Create a folder (directory) called test-files in the redi-2021-09-16 folder List the contents of the directory that you are in and make sure that it looks something like: 1test1.txt hello.txt test-files  Move test1.txt into the test-files directory. List the contents of test-files and make sure it contains only test1.txt, and list the contents of redi-2021-09-16 to confirm that test1.txt has been moved.  5. Copy files and directories  Copy of hello.txt into the test-files directory. (Hint: this can be done in one command by copying the file to the proper location, or by creating a copy and then moving the file.) Rename the original hello.txt to original-hello.txt. (Hint: \u0026quot;renaming\u0026quot; is the same as moving a file to a new file path.) Make a copy of the test-files directory named test-files-copy. List the contents of test-files-copy and make sure that it contains both test1.txt and original-hello.txt.  6. Delete files and directories Be careful with this one! Please double check the command with one of the teachers before removing anything, since anything removed via rm cannot be retrieved!!\n In the test-files-copy, delete the test1.txt file. Confirm that test-files-copy contains only original-hello.txt. Delete the entire test-files-copy directory. List the contents of the redi-2021-09-16 directory and make sure that the test-files-copy directory is gone, but that the original test-files directory and other files are still present.  (Optional) 7. Additional Practice These are additional challenge tasks that are meant to be extra challenging, in case the previous tasks went by more quickly than expected! :)\n Use the man-pages and Google to understand how to use the grep command. Use this command to search for occurrences of the text \u0026quot;my name is\u0026quot; in the redi-2021-09-16 directory. (Hint: you can use the -r option to do this) Create a journal/diary as a group with the following structure: the journal folder should contain year folders on the first level. Within a year folder are month folders, which contain text files for each individual day. A file path for one of these may look like: .../journal/2021/09/16.txt. Create a few entries that have some text!

Lesson Goals  Learn the difference between procedural vs. object-oriented programming. Learn the pillars of object-oriented programming in Python  Classes Objects Constructor functions Object Methods Inheritance    1. Check-In  What was particularly challenging last class? Are there any remaining questions from last class? What exercises were the most challenging? (Respond in the chat)  2. Procedural Programming Procedural programming involves writing sequential code which is executed from top to the bottom of the file. You are not allowed to switch steps otherwise the program will fail to run. You can think of procedural programming like the process of boiling some spaghetti.\n You get a clean pot You pour some water into the pot You switch on the cooker You wait for the water to start boiling You add the Spaghetti You add some salt You wait for about 10 to 15 minutes for the Spaghetti to cook  Here are some characteristics of procedural programming:\n In procedural programming, program is divided into small parts called functions. Procedural programming follows top down approach. Adding new data and functions is not easy. Procedural programming does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is less secure. In procedural programming, function is more important than data. Procedural programs are not modelled according to real-world structure. Procedural programming languages include C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic etc  3. Object-Oriented Programming Object-oriented programming involves writing code in terms of the objects that make up the problem you are trying to solve. The definitions of these objects in the code can be switched around without causing the program to fail. You can think of object-oriented programming like the process of solving a jigsaw puzzle.\nHere are some characteristics of object-oriented programming:\n In object-oriented programming, the program is divided into small parts called objects. Object-oriented programming follows bottom up approach. Adding new data and function is easy. Object-oriented programming provides data hiding so it is more secure. In object-oriented programming, data is more important than function. Object-oriented programs are modelled according to real-world structure. Object-oriented programming languages include C++, Java, Python, C# etc.  4. Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming in Python Classes Classes represent a group of objects you would like to manage in your program. Classes in python are declared as follows:\n1class class_name: 2 class_body For example if you are writing code to manage the pets at a pet clinic then your program is managing different pets, whether they are dogs, cats, turtles etc. In your program you would represent all these different breeds using a Pet class.\n1class Pet: 2 pass  Note: The pass keyword is used when we do not want to specify any details of the class.  Objects When we define a class only the description or a blueprint of all possible objects defined by that class is created. For example one particular cat at the pet clinic is an object of the Pet class. When you create an object from a class in your code, you assign it to a variable to allow you do something meaningful with that specific object. You create an object and assign it to a variable as follows:\n1object_variable = class_name() For example, an object for a cat called Maya can be created from the Pet class as follows:\n1maya = Pet() Now you can print the Maya object\n1print(maya) 2# outputs something like -\u0026gt; \u0026lt;__main__.Pet object at 0x7ff41e9bcdd0\u0026gt;  Note: The 0x7ff41e9bcdd0 above is the address of Maya in memory on my computer. The value will be different on your computer  Constructor functions The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.\nTo understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() constructor function.\nAll classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when an object of the class is being constructed.\nUse the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:\nFor example, in the example from above\n1maya = Pet() We know that object relates to a cat called Maya because we stored the object in a variable called maya.\nNow consider if we instead named the variable differently:\n1pet_one = Pet() We've lost all hints that the pet_one object actually refers to Maya. We can add a constructor function to the Pet class which will allow us to give names to pets objects we create.\n1class Pet: 2 def __init__(self, name): 3 self.name = name  Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current class object and is used to access variables that belong to the object.  With the new constructor function added to the Pet class, we can now create pet objects with actual names\n1pet_one = Pet(\u0026#34;Maya\u0026#34;) 2pet_two = Pet(\u0026#34;Felix\u0026#34;) And we can selectively print the names of each pet\n1print(pet_one.name) 2print(pet_two.name) 3# outputs 4# Maya 5# Felix Object Methods Objects can also contain functions called Methods. Methods allow the program to perform actions on objects.\nLet us add a hello method to the Pet class that the pets can use to introduce themselves (if they could speak)\n1class Pet: 2 def __init__(self, name): 3 self.name = name 4 5 def hello(self): 6 print(\u0026#34;Hello my name is \u0026#34; + self.name) Now we can create a pet called called Maya and have her say hello!\n1pet_one = Pet(\u0026#34;maya\u0026#34;) 2pet_one.hello() 3# output -\u0026gt; Hello my name is maya Class inheritance Inheritance allows us to define a class that is a sub-category of another class. For example at the pet clinic, we have a Pet class. But using the Pet class, we cannot differentiate between cats, dogs, turtles or birds.\nWe can create new classes for the different kinds of animals at the pet clinic and have all of them inherit from the Pet class.\n1class Pet: 2 def __init__(self, name): 3 self.name = name 4 5 def hello(self): 6 print(\u0026#34;Hello my name is \u0026#34; + self.name) 7 8class Cat(Pet): 9 pass 10 11class Dog(Pet): 12 pass 13 14class Turtle(Pet): 15 pass 16 17class Bird(Pet): 18 pass The Pet class is known as the parent class.\nThe Cat, Dog, Turtle and Bird classes are known as child class.\nNow we can create more pet objects using their specific classes and they will all be able to say hello because they've inherited the hello method from the Pet class\n1cat_one = Cat(\u0026#34;maya\u0026#34;) 2dog_one = Dog(\u0026#34;bosco\u0026#34;) 3turtle_one = Turtle(\u0026#34;speedy\u0026#34;) 4bird_one = Bird(\u0026#34;diver\u0026#34;) 5 6cat_one.hello() 7dog_one.hello() 8turtle_one.hello() 9bird_one.hello() 10 11# outputs 12# Hello my name is maya 13# Hello my name is bosco 14# Hello my name is speedy 15# Hello my name is diver Even though we now have various child classes of the parent class Pet, each of those child classes have characteristics that apply to only them. For example cats can meow, dogs can bark, birds can fly and turtles can hide in their shell.\nWe can add more specific class methods into the various child classes to provide more specific behaviors.\nLets add:\n A meow method to the Cat class which causes the cat to make the meow sound A bark method to the Dog class which causes the cat to bark A fly method to the Bird class which causes the bird to fly A hide method to the Turtle class which causes the turtle to go into its shell  1class Pet: 2 def __init__(self, name): 3 self.name = name 4 5 def hello(self): 6 print(\u0026#34;Hello my name is \u0026#34; + self.name) 7 8class Cat(Pet): 9 def meow(self): 10 print(\u0026#34;Meeeeeooooww! I am a cat!\u0026#34;) 11 12class Dog(Pet): 13 def bark(self): 14 print(\u0026#34;Wooof! Woof! I am a dog!\u0026#34;) 15 16class Turtle(Pet): 17 def hide(self): 18 print(\u0026#34;Hide! I\u0026#39;m shy! I am a turtle!\u0026#34;) 19 20class Bird(Pet): 21 def fly(self): 22 print(\u0026#34;Swoooosh! I\u0026#39;m flying away! I am a bird!\u0026#34;) Now lets get all our pets to first say hello and then perform the actions they are good at\n1cat_one = Cat(\u0026#34;maya\u0026#34;) 2dog_one = Dog(\u0026#34;bosco\u0026#34;) 3turtle_one = Turtle(\u0026#34;speedy\u0026#34;) 4bird_one = Bird(\u0026#34;diver\u0026#34;) 5 6cat_one.hello() 7cat_one.meow() 8 9dog_one.hello() 10dog_one.bark() 11 12turtle_one.hello() 13turtle_one.hide() 14 15bird_one.hello() 16bird_one.fly() 17 18# outputs 19# Hello my name is maya 20# Meeeeeooooww! I am a cat! 21# Hello my name is bosco 22# Wooof! Woof! I am a dog! 23# Hello my name is speedy 24# Hide! I\u0026#39;m shy! I am a turtle! 25# Hello my name is diver 26# Swoooosh! I\u0026#39;m flying away! I am a bird! 5. Task: Extend the pet Clinic Example  Write out all the code in the examples above in your preferred python environment and verify that they work for you Add the ability to specify an age of the pet to the Pet class Create a list of 20 pets:  5 cats with different names and ages 5 dogs with different names and ages 5 turtles with different names and ages 5 birds with different names and ages   Update the hello method in the Pet class to also print the age of the pet Using a for-loop, go through the list of 20 pets and for each pet with an even-numbered age, make the pet say hello!  6. Bonus Task: Implement a REDI School Management System  Create a School class which represents all the different REDI school locations Each school location will be an object of the School class Create a Course class which represents all the different courses offered at REDI School Each actual course will be an object of the Course class Create a Student class which represents all the different students in a REDI School course Each actual student will be an object of the Student class Each student object must have a name Each course object must have a course name and a list of students Each school object must have a location name and a list of courses Test your system by:  Creating 3 REDI School objects representing the locatios in Germany Creating 1 course object representing a course offered at one of the schools (3 course objects in total) Creating students objects representing each of the students of the Intro To CS course.

Create a local repository First, create a new directory and give it the same name as your GitHub username (the reason for this will become clear later):\n1mkdir \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Move into that directory\n1cd \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Initialise an empty git repository with the branch name, main:\n1git init 1git checkout -b main Now you have an empty local repository üéâ\n2. Make a commit Next, we want to make changes within this repository and save (or commit!) them.\nA commit is a way to save changes you‚Äôve made to a repository. It is powerful because it allows you to keep snapshots of your repository at any given time.\nFirst, we create a new file:\n1touch README.md This is a README file using markdown syntax.\nNext, we will add some text to this file to say hello to the world.\n1echo \u0026#34;# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; :)\u0026#34; \u0026gt; README.md Then view the status of the current git repository:\n1git status The README.md file will appear in the untracked files. We want to track this file and add it to the staging area so it will be included in the next commit:\n1git add . Then check the status again.\nLet's commit this file with a helpful commit message:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Initialise repository with a README\u0026#34; Finally, we can take a look at the log, to view metadata about our previous commits:\n1git log 3. Create a remote repository (on GitHub) Sign in to GitHub: https://github.com\nOn the top navigation bar, click the + button and select ‚ÄòNew repository‚Äô\nCreate a new repository: Give the repository the same name as your username, make sure it is ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô then click ‚ÄòCreate repository‚Äô.\n4. Push the contents of your local repository to the remote Now we want to associate our local repository with the one we have created on GitHub and push the contents of our local repository to GitHub.\nConnect the local repository with the remote repository:\n1git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git Verify that the remote was added:\n1git remote -v You should see the following output:\n1origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (fetch) 2origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (push) Finally push your changes to GitHub:\n1git push -u origin main Check your GitHub repository to see if it contains your README file, and look at your profile to see that it is displayed!\nWell done on sharing your first repository üéâ\n5. Create a branch Now we want to make some changes to our README, but we don't want to commit them to the main branch yet. Therefore, we will use another branch.\nCreate a new branch, called ‚Äòadd-more-detail‚Äô:\n1git checkout -b add-more-detail Open the README.md file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad or TextEdit) and make some changes. Here is a template you can use:\n1# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; üëã 2 3Pronouns: \u0026lt;your pronouns\u0026gt; 4Learning: command line, Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python 5Interests: \u0026lt;your interests\u0026gt; You can be as creative as you want by adding text, emoji, images or gifs (and more!).\nOnce you have made some changes it is time to add and commit them:\n1git add . 2git commit -m \u0026#34;Add some new information\u0026#34; Then push the branch with the changes to the remote repository:\n1git push origin add-more-detail Take a look at your README profile - has it been updated?\n6. Create a pull request Let's say we want to get feedback on the changes we've made. We can do this with a Pull Request.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch. Select 'Create new pull request'.\nAssign the person you are paired with to review your pull request.\nReviewing a pull request If somebody has requested your feedback, you can use this as an opportunity to:\n Ask questions and provide feedback about the changes Approve the changes Request further changes  Once you have reviewed the changes, click Review changes and then Approve.\nMerge a pull request Once your pull request has been reviewed, you can merge it so that the main branch is updated with your changes.\nOn your pull request, go to the bottom of the page and select Rebase and merge.\nYou can now go to your command line, checkout the main branch and pull the changes so that your local main branch is up to date:\n1git checkout main 2git pull origin main Finally, take a look at your updated GitHub profile README and celebrate what you've achieved!\n7. Fork and clone a repository Note üìù\nThis task is unrelated to the previous tasks, but has been included because these features are useful.\nA fork is a copy of someone else‚Äôs remote repository, sometimes you will make a fork to build on someone else's work.\nNavigate to https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife\nOn the top-right, select 'Fork'.\nOnce you have forked the repository, we can clone it to download a copy of the repository to your local machine. On the repository, select Code and copy the HTTPS link. Then navigate to your terminal and run:\n1git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git 8.

Try not to look at the solutions until you have finished the problem. Copy the skeleton code into your local development setup (VSCode, PyCharm, or Google Colab) and try to achieve the \u0026quot;expected output\u0026quot; described for each exercise. Make sure everyone in your group has understood and produced the proper output before moving on to the next task in this section :)\n4. Exercises (part 2) In groups, let's start building a card game in Python. (While we won't implement an entire game in this activity, implementing a Blackjack, Poker, or other game-player could be a fun project!)\nThe goal will be to describe the real-world situation of a deck of cards using Python code. This is meant to be challenging; Google is your friend here, use it to look up how to do things and to help you understand the material!\nExample solutions to parts 1-3 will be posted after class :)\n If you aren't sure what a deck of cards is, feel free to check out this Wikipedia page or chat with your group :). The rest of this exercise assumes a standard 52-card deck (French deck), but feel free to use a different style if you wish.\n  Define a Card class.\n What properties should this class have? Include an object method that displays the card. (Hint: you can print the properties of the card.) Test your implementation by creating and displaying a few cards (ex. Ace of Spades, 4 of Hearts, 10 of Diamonds...)    Define a Deck class.\n What properties should this class have? In the init constructor, make sure to build some representation of the 52-card deck. (Hint: use a nested for loop to create all the necessary cards) Include an object method that displays the deck. Test your implementation by displaying the deck. Is the whole deck there and as you expect?    (Challenge) Define a Hand class. A Hand is a list of cards that has a total value. For now, go ahead and assume that the value of a Hand is the sum of the values of each card and you can feel free to use the following scheme: Ace = 1 point, 2 = 2 points ... , King = 13 points. (Hint: consider using a dictionary mapping from card type to value.)\n What properties should this class have? Include a method to get the value of the hand. Include a method to display the hand. Test your implementation by creating (instantiating) a few Hand objects and displaying them.    (Optional challenge tasks / Project ideas) Note: all of these are supposed to be challenging, and implementing a combination of these (or the last one) could be an exciting project later in the coming weeks as well! Feel free to extend the example above by picking any of the additional tasks to \u0026quot;add-on\u0026quot; to your deck of cards:\n Deck: add a draw function which returns the next card drawn in the deck. Deck: add a shuffle function which gives the deck a random order. (Hint: use the Python random library to do this; feel free to Google or ask for help on how to access these functions) Hand: choose a game of your choice (i.e. Blackjack, Poker, ...) and write a method to either 1) compare two hands or 2) an object method that tells you if this is a winnning hand Game: (this could be a project for later in the class ;)) choose a 2-player card game of your choice and implement a game played by two auto-players ???: feel free to add additional classes or properties that you think make sense or are missing!

Kahoot: Python Classes Review Let's do a Kahoot to check our understanding of the concepts we've learned so far.\nPython Activity 0. Introduction We are going to use Python to create a text adventure which runs on the command line.\nThe story will follow you as the main character, and your attempt to travel out of Berlin to visit M√ºggelsee on a sunny day.\nYou will have to choose a mode of transport and will encounter different obstacles on your way to the lake. The modes of transport that you can choose are walking, bicycle or S-Bahn.\nBased on the choices you make, the game will have a different outcome.\nDEMO\n1. Setup project  Create a new folder called python_adventures In the folder, create a new file called, adventure.py  2. Classes and Objects Brainstorm what you would want to represent as objects in order to create a story which contains a character and different modes of transport.\n What classes can you come up with? What instance attributes could they have? What class methods could they have?    SOLUTION  There are many ways that you could solve this, which means there is no exact right or wrong answer. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will create the following:\n A Story class, with three methods: start, middle, end. A Character class, with two instance attributes: name and transportation. A Transportation class, with two instance attributes: speed and description, and with one method: encounter_obstacles Since we have three methods of transportation, we will have three subclasses of transportation: Walk, Bicycle and SBahn.   i. Go ahead and create these classes and methods in adventure.py. For now, leave the methods empty.\n  SOLUTION - Story Class  1class Story: 2 def __init__(self): 3 pass 4 5 def start(self): 6 pass 7 8 def middle(self, character, transportation): 9 pass 10 11 def end(self, character): 12 pass 13 14 new_story = Story() 15 new_story.start()    SOLUTION - Character Class  1class Character: 2 def __init__(self, name, transportation): 3 self.name = name 4 self.transportation = transportation  When defining the Bicycle, Walk and SBahn classes, you can already set the following name, speed, and description:\nWalk\nname: \u0026quot;walking\u0026quot;\nspeed: \u0026quot;slow\u0026quot;\ndescription: \u0026quot;It is a long and tiring walk, but scenic.üö∂\u0026quot;\nBicycle\nname: \u0026quot;bicycle\u0026quot;\nspeed: \u0026quot;average\u0026quot;\ndescription: \u0026quot;Efficient and green - cycling is a great way to explore! üö≤\u0026quot;\nS-Bahn\nname: \u0026quot;S-Bahn\u0026quot;\nspeed: \u0026quot;fast\u0026quot;\ndescription: \u0026quot;The S-Bahn is busy with people getting out of the city today, but you can read a book, listen to music and gaze out the window. üöâ\u0026quot;\n  SOLUTION - Transportation Classes  1class Transportation: 2 def __init__(self, name, speed, description, obstacles): 3 self.name = name 4 self.speed = speed 5 self.description = description 6 7 def encounter_obstacles(self): 8 pass 9 10 11class Walk(Transportation): 12 def __init__(self): 13 self.name = \u0026#34;walking\u0026#34; 14 self.speed = \u0026#34;slow\u0026#34; 15 self.description = \u0026#34;It is a long and tiring walk, but scenic.üö∂\u0026#34; 16 17 def encounter_obstacles(self): 18 pass 19 20 21class SBahn(Transportation): 22 def __init__(self): 23 self.name = \u0026#34;sbahn\u0026#34; 24 self.speed = \u0026#34;fast\u0026#34; 25 self.description = \u0026#34;The S-Bahn is busy with people getting out of the city today, but you can read a book, listen to music and gaze out the window. üöâ\u0026#34; 26 27 def encounter_obstacles(self): 28 pass 29 30 31class Bicycle(Transportation): 32 def __init__(self): 33 self.name = \u0026#34;bicycle\u0026#34; 34 self.speed = \u0026#34;average\u0026#34; 35 self.description = \u0026#34;Efficient and green - cycling is a great way to explore! üö≤\u0026#34; 36 37 def encounter_obstacles(self): 38 pass  ii. At the end of the file, create a new_story object from the Story class. Call the start method on new story, so that a new story is created when the program is run.\n3. Create the story introduction The introduction of the story will always be the same. We should ask the player for their name, introduce the story with some opening text and ask the player which mode of transport they would like to take.\ni. First, we want to create an introduction for the player to start the story. Please copy and paste the following function into python_adventure.py. This function should be kept outside of any class. (Ordinarily you should not copy and paste from tutorials, but in this case there is a lot of text which is not useful for you to type out):\n1def introduction_text(name): 2 print(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) 3 print( 4 \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s a beautiful summer\u0026#39;s day in Berlin, and you are stuck in Hermannplatz :(\u0026#34; 5 ) 6 print( 7 \u0026#34;You don\u0026#39;t want to be here. It is too noisy, there is too much traffic and all this concrete makes it uncomfortably warm\u0026#34; 8 ) 9 print(\u0026#34;The lakes are calling...\u0026#34;) 10 print(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) # The purpose of this print statement is to make the CLI output easier to read 11 print(f\u0026#34;Well {name}, today we go to M√ºggelsee!\u0026#34;) 12 print(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) ii. Go to the start() method of the Story class. Using the input() method, ask the player what their name is. Assign their input to a variable, name.\niii. In the next line of start(), call the function introduction_text and pass in the name variable as an argument.\niv. In the next line of start(), ask the user how they plan to travel to the lake using the string \u0026quot;The only question is, how should we go to the lake? a. walking, b. bicycle or c. sbahn\\n\u0026quot;. Assign the input to a variable called choice.\nv. In the next part of start(), we will be using an if, elif, else statement to check the choice. If it is a, create a new variable called transportation and assign the object Walk() to it, if choice is b assign the object Bicycle() to transportation, otherwise if the choice is c assign the object SBahn() to transportation. Use the else branch to catch the scenario where a player inputs none of these options by printing a message to the player and exiting.\nvi. In the next part of start, we want to create a Character object, using the name and transportation choice that the player has given us already.\nvii. Finally, to complete this method, we will want to call the method to start the next part of the story middle, and pass the character and transportation objects to it.\n  SOLUTION - START  1def introduction_text(name): 2 print(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) 3 print( 4 \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s a beautiful summer\u0026#39;s day in Berlin, and you are stuck in Hermannplatz :(\u0026#34; 5 ) 6 print( 7 \u0026#34;You don\u0026#39;t want to be here.

The middle of the story The middle or content of the story will vary depending on the mode of transportation that the user takes. We will use the middle() method as a way to begin this in the same way for each mode of transport, and then use the encounter_obstacles() method of each transport type to create a different storyline.\ni. To begin the middle() of the story, we print a message to the player to confirm their choice of transport and share some details about it. In the first line of middle(), print the following message to the player: \u0026quot;Travelling by {transportation.name} is {transportation.speed}. {transportation.description}\\n\u0026quot; (Hint: you will need to use an f-string).\nii. Next call the encounter_obstacles() method of the transportation object that you passed into middle() method.\niii. Lastly, call the end() method which will trigger the end of the story.\nWe haven't yet created any obstacles for the player, we will do this in Section 6.\n  SOLUTION - MIDDLE  1 def middle(self, character, transportation): 2 print( 3 f\u0026#34;Travelling by {transportation.name} is {transportation.speed}. {transportation.description}\\n\u0026#34; 4 ) 5 transportation.encounter_obstacles() 6 self.end(character)  Run the program and see what happens!\n5. End of the story We will reach the end of the story when the player's character has reached the lake. When this happens, we will print a message to the player and the game will end.\ni. Print a message to the player, which says: \u0026quot;Yay, {character.name}! You reached the lake by {character.transportation.name}. Time to swim and spend the rest of the day snoozing in the sun ‚õµ\u0026quot;\n  SOLUTION - END  1 def end(self, character): 2 print( 3 f\u0026#34;Yay, {character.name}! You reached the lake by {character.transportation.name}. Time to swim and spend the rest of the day snoozing in the sun ‚õµ\u0026#34; 4 )  Run the program and see what happens!\n6. Fill in the obstacles of the story Each story will have some obstacles, and depending on the player's choice when encountering these obstacles, the character will or will not make it to the lake.\nWalk There is one obstacle when walking. Since it is a long walk from Hermannplatz, if the player leaves too late it will be dark when they arrive.\ni. Write code to ask the player the following question: \u0026quot;What time do you leave Hermannplatz? a. Before 14:00 b. After 14:00\\n\u0026quot;. Assign their input to a variable called choice.\nii. If the choice is a, print the following message: \u0026quot;You are very tired when you get to the lake and fall asleep.\\n While you are asleep a wild boar runs off with your belongings üêó\u0026quot;\niii. If the choice is b, print the following message: \u0026quot;Oh no, it is too late. By the time you reach the lake, it is already dark and time to go home. üåâ :(\u0026quot; and exit the program.\nQuestion: what happpens if the choice is neither a nor b?\n  SOLUTION - WALK OBSTACLES  1 def encounter_obstacles(self): 2 choice = input( 3 \u0026#34;What time do you leave Hermannplatz? a.

Write code to ask the player the following question: \u0026quot;You are cycling past the Landwehr canal and spot your friend in a boat on the canal.\\nWhat do you do? a. Stop and join the boat party or b. wave and continue\\n\u0026quot;. Assign their input to a variable called choice.\nii.

Python Overview Q\u0026amp;A Intro   What is Python?\nPython is a high-level programming language\n  What is a high-level programming language?\n \u0026quot;program\u0026quot;: writing instructions for your computer to execute; this could be a simple \u0026quot;calculator\u0026quot; program that adds two numbers, it could be something that prints out values to your terminal or sends information to a remote server/web-page, etc. \u0026quot;programming language\u0026quot;: the language (set of words used according to specific syntax rules) that lets you write a program that can be executed on a machine \u0026quot;high-level\u0026quot;: there are different ways of interacting with the computer; at the lowest level, this is the binary code that computers can read and execute. Above that are different levels of closeness to machine-readable code: directly above is machine or assembly code that is slightly more readable but also compiles into this binary code for computers. There are more levels above this, and at the highest level (like Python), code words in human-readable languages (like English) represent large series of simple assembly steps. You can write some complex set of loops, etc. and the \u0026quot;Python interpreter\u0026quot; \u0026quot;interprets\u0026quot; these instructions in Python, turning them into something that the machine can comprehend. You don't have to worry about managing how your computer stores memory (more on this later), since Python takes care of this.    What are terms that you may hear when discussing programs and programming languages?\n \u0026quot;abstraction\u0026quot;: something that has usually \u0026quot;hidden away\u0026quot; the inner complexities of a system; usually simplifies how we understand something. \u0026quot;under the hood\u0026quot;: the details of how something works when you look past the \u0026quot;layers of abstraction\u0026quot; (see above); digging into the numerous, smaller steps of how a program, application, etc. actually functions \u0026quot;black box\u0026quot;: a system whose inner-workings you do not understand; all you can see are the inputs and outputs. [ inputs -\u0026gt; BLACK_BOX -\u0026gt; outputs ]    How and in what fields is Python typically used?\n Data science: Python has many libraries (including pandas) that are useful for doing data analysis or statistics. Can be very efficient in how fast it computes data, and is for many people easier to read compared with other programming languages. Machine Learning, Deep Learning: Python notebooks and libraries (including TensorFlow and keras) make it easy and clear to create neural networks and train machine learning models for prediction and generation tasks. Running systems and infrastructure: SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) often use python as a scripting language to quickly examine, configure, and maintain infrastructure systems. Compared with other languages, it takes little code/time to write and execute a function in Python.    What examples of things you can do with Python?\n Write programs of all kinds! Write a backend server for your web application, to process (receive, send) HTTP requests Use pandas to analyze a data set Create and train a neural network or other machine learning/deep learning model ???    What questions do you have so far?\n  1. Hands-on Python Activity Go through this Exercise at your own pace in your groups. Make sure you are all doing this together and asking questions.\nThere is no rush -- it is completely fine not to finish the whole exercise!!\nThe purpose here is to start getting familiar with Python syntax through trial-and-error (so getting things wrong is completely expected and part of this process!). After this section, we will go through the activity as a group and discuss our observations of rules and concepts from Python that we took from the exercise.\nWhen you get an answer wrong, make sure you look at the correct answer below and try to understand what the expression means from the correct answer.\nRefresher of some math operators that you will see:\n +: addition -: subtraction *: multiplication a \u0026lt; b: less than --\u0026gt; \u0026quot;a is less than b\u0026quot; a \u0026gt; b: greater than --\u0026gt; \u0026quot;a is greater than b\u0026quot;  2. Python Concepts - Sharing \u0026amp; Synthesizing We will go over many of these concepts in more detail in the coming weeks, so no problem if it takes a little time for them to make sense!\nOne note about the code snippets below: in Python, we can write comments by using the # symbol; anything after this symbol is not interpreted as code or executed. This can be a really convenient way to write notes to yourselves (or future developers!) when trying to understand code you wrote.\n What observations did you have from the exercise?  Data Types   What is a data type?\n  What are examples of different data types that you saw?\n strings (ex: 'asdf', 'hello my name is x', 'a', '123') integers (ex: 1, -100, 1383234) floats (floating point values) (ex: 1.0, -100.1234, 0.0000003, 1e5) booleans (ex: True, False) lists (ex: [3, 1, 'r', 'e'], [], [3.2, 3, 4.5]) functions (ex: def my_function (a, b): ...)  (more data types that weren't shown in this exercise will be discussed in later sessions)\n  Variables   What is a variable? What's an example?\nSome word (starting with a letter, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscore _) that represents some value. We set the value of a variable with =, for example: test_var = 10 sets the variable test_var to be equal to the value of 10. Setting the value of a variable is often called assigning a variable.\n  Iterables (lists, strings, ...)   What does the len keyword do? i.e. len('asdf') or len([1,2,3,4])\nlen gets the length of any \u0026quot;iterable\u0026quot; -- any \u0026quot;thing\u0026quot; that is made up of other things that you can \u0026quot;iterate\u0026quot; or count through: list, string, tuple, dictionary, set...\n  What does the [#] syntax do?\nThis indexes into an iterable and gets you the # value of it. Note that the \u0026quot;first\u0026quot; index is \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, because we 0-index in Python. For example:\n1 a = \u0026#39;asdf\u0026#39; 2 b = [1,2,3,4] 3 a[0] 4 # outputs: -\u0026gt; \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; 5 b[3] 6 # outputs: -\u0026gt; 4   Booleans and conditions   What does the == symbol mean? What about !=?\n== is \u0026quot;equals\u0026quot;, != is \u0026quot;does not equal\u0026quot;.\n  What is the difference between = and ==?\n= is for assigning some value to a variable, while == is for testing for equality between the two sides.\n  What does the if keyword do?\nThis is a conditional statement: if CONDITION: means: \u0026quot;if CONDITION evaluates to True, then execute the code that follows directly after the statement\u0026quot;\n  How about an if ... else statement?\n1if CONDITION_A: 2 STATEMENT_A 3else: 4 STATEMENT_B In this example, \u0026quot;if CONDITION_A evaluates to True, then execute STATEMENT_A. Otherwise (if CONDITION_A evaluates to False), then execute STATEMENT_B. --\u0026gt;\n  How about if ... elif ... else?\n1if CONDITION_A: 2 STATEMENT_A 3elif CONDITION_B: 4 STATEMENT_B 5else: 6 STATEMENT_C In this example, \u0026quot;if CONDITION_A evaluates to True, then execute STATEMENT_A only. Otherwise (if CONDITION_A evaluates to False), then check if CONDITION_B evaluates to True and if so, execute STATEMENT_B only. If both CONDITION_A and CONDITION_B evaluate to False, then execute STATEMENT_C. Note that here, we are only ever execute one of the STATEMENT_'s, even if multiple conditions evaluate to True.\n  Functions   What is a function?\n1def my_test_function(a): 2 return a A function is a sequence of steps or tasks (written in a block of code), which may or may not take in arguments. Whenever we call a function, we execute this defined set of steps (with any arguments passed in). The above example function takes in some value and simply returns, or gives us back, this value when we call it like so: my_test_function(12) # evaluates to 12\n  3. (if there is time) \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; in Python It's something of a tradition in the Computer Science world when learning a new language to write code that outputs \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;. Check out this Wikipedia article for more information on why :).\nFor today, go ahead and try that out in this Python playground, which will allow you to execute some test code by clicking on the Play button (triangle) on the top of the console window.\nExample solutions will be posted in a few days :)\nTask 0: write code that outputs \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; Tip: there is a built-in print function in Python that takes some input and outputs this to standard out (STDOUT), which is in this case the right side of the playground console. (Recall that the # stands for a \u0026quot;comment\u0026quot; in Python, meaning that this line is just a \u0026quot;note\u0026quot; to yourself and does not need to be included.)\nExample usage:\n1print(\u0026#34;asdf asdf\u0026#34;) 2# outputs -\u0026gt; asdf asdf 3print(\u0026#34;my name is\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Robot\u0026#34;) 4# outputs -\u0026gt; my name is Robot   A Solution:\n1print(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) Task 1: create and call a function that prints \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; Tip: Modify the code you wrote in the previous task so that this happens within a function that you define.  A Solution:\n1def hello_world(): 2 print(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) 3 4# Let\u0026#39;s call the function 5hello_world() Task 2: create a function that returns the string \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot;. Call this function and print the output. A solution:\n1def hello_world(): 2 return \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; 3 4print(hello_world()) Task 3: modify your function so you can greet a specific name: \u0026quot;Hello, Person\u0026quot; In other words:\n1my_hello_world(\u0026#34;Noor\u0026#34;) 2# expected output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Noor\u0026#34; A solution:\n1def hello_world(name): 2 return (\u0026#34;Hello, \u0026#34; + name) 3 4print(hello_world(\u0026#34;Noor\u0026#34;)) 5# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Noor\u0026#34; 6print(hello_world(\u0026#34;Jose\u0026#34;)) 7# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Jose\u0026#34; Another solution:\n1def hello_world(name): 2 print(\u0026#34;Hello, \u0026#34; + name) 3 4hello_world(\u0026#34;Noor\u0026#34;) 5# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Noor\u0026#34; 6hello_world(\u0026#34;Jose\u0026#34;) 7# output -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello, Jose\u0026#34; Additional practice (all optional)  Modify your \u0026quot;greeter\u0026quot; using any of the concepts we discussed; perhaps include a conditional expression (i.e. only greet IF ...). Try to write and evaluate any Python expressions that you saw in the silent teacher activity in the playground. Write your own function to return or print some value.

It‚Äôs written in what people like to call ‚Äúplaintext‚Äù, which is exactly the sort of text you‚Äôre used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` ).\nUnlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It‚Äôs quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments.\nTo get started with the tutorial let¬¥s jump here:\nMARKDOWN TUTORIAL\nCreating your own journal! 0. Command Line cheat sheet Remember that you can look up what a command does by using the man (manual-pages) command on Mac and Linux, or help command on Windows cmd. For example: man echo would give you information on what the echo command does and how to use it.     command what it does     echo print some text   pwd print working directory (print the path to where I currently am in the file system)   ls list the contents of the directory   cd change directory (this moves you, the viewer of the terminal, to a new location in the file system)   cat print the contents of the file   cp copy a file (note: to copy a directory you probably need to add an option (like -r) to copy a directory)   mv move a file or directory to a new location (note: this can also be useful for changing the name of a file/directory)   mkdir make a directory   touch create a new file   rm delete a file (note: to delete a directory, add the option -r or -d)   \u0026gt; the redirection operator (X \u0026gt; Y will send the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will overwrite the existing file.)    0. Git cheat sheet These are some of the most famous commands you need.\nWhere you see \u0026lt;...\u0026gt;, you will have to replace the whole thing with the expected input. For example, git add  would become git add ./docs/\n   command what it does     git clone \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt; Clone repo located at  onto local machine. Original repo can be located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH.   git config user.name \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user.   git add \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt; Stage all changes in  for the next commit. Replace  with a  to change a specific file.   git commit -m \u0026quot;\u0026lt;message\u0026gt;\u0026quot; Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use  as the commit message.   git status List which files are staged unstaged, and untracked.   git log Display the entire commit history using the default format.

Fork and clone your new Journal First, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the journal. (If you don't already have a designated folder for class materials, create a directory for this and navigate into it.) Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of another repository, usually one that is stored on a remote server like GitHub.\nFork this repository. In the top right corner, click Fork. You may be prompted with a question like \u0026quot;Where should we fork this repository to?\u0026quot; If so, click your GitHub username; this will create a copy of the repository to your account.\nYou should then be automatically taken to the main page of this repository.\nOn the upper right side, click Code (in green) and copy the SSH link. Then in your terminal run git clone \u0026lt;link-you-copied\u0026gt;. For example, this should look something like the following:\n1git clone git@github.com:ReDI-School/autumn-2021-intro-to-programming-md-journal.git Check that this directory now exists. (Hint: list the contents of the directory you are in, and make sure you see the cloned folder.)\nMove into that directory (small hint -\u0026gt; write cd autumn and then press the key TAB and it will autocomplete):\n1cd autumn-2021-intro-to-programming-md-journal Check the status of the git repository:\n1git status You should see output something like:\n1On branch main 2Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/main\u0026#39;. 3 4nothing to commit, working tree clean If so, great! You have successfully forked and cloned this repository. If not, check in with someone in your group or raise your hand so one of the teachers to help before moving on to the next steps.\n2. Checkout a new branch One of the great things about Git is being able to work on the same repository as others at the same time. A typical way of doing this when working on a project is by creating and checking out a new branch (via git checkout -b \u0026lt;branch-name\u0026gt;), making changes and committing your work, and pushing this work to your separate branch. Once you are ready to publish your changes to the main branch, you can create a pull request (PR) to have others review your changes and merge them to the main branch.\nEven though you are working on your own repository alone (since you forked, this is your own repository), let's practice creating a new branch so we can make some changes there and eventually merge this back to the main branch. Let's call this branch \u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch (leave out the \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, for example, for me, I would call the branch marcshaw/journal1):\n1git checkout -b \u0026lt;your-github-username\u0026gt;/test-branch Check the status of the repository again before moving on to the next step, and make sure that you are on the correct branch. (Hint: run git status which displays the branch you are on, and make sure this is what you expect.)\n3. Open with VSCode the folder you have just created Open VScode! :D once you are there let's click on file in the top left corner and click on Open.... Look for the the folder in your system you have just created (probably should be around /home) and click it.\nYour VSCode should show now on the left side the differents files and folders from the current scenario.\n4. Complete the tasks in the README.md file from the repository you have just created. In the README.md file from the repo you have just copied there is a section called ## TASKS. Go slowly one by one and complete them by marking them with a X\n5. Adding and committing some changes Once completed! let's make the world know about our recipes.\n  Check the status of the repository via git status. If you do not see something that says you deleted a file, please ask someone in your group or a teacher for help before moving on.\n  Stage the changes by running git add . or git add --all and check the status again to make sure the changes have shown up in your staging area. They should be green\n  Create a commit now to \u0026quot;save\u0026quot; your changes--in this case, the deleted file. Try to leave a helpful commit message like below, replacing  with the file you deleted:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Created my first journal!\u0026#34;   Check that the commit was successful by checking the status of the repository (git status) and checking the log (git log). You should see the commit message that you added at the top of the log, in addition to some previous commits from before you cloned the repository.\n  Let's go ahead and push these commits so far to the remote repository. Run the following, replacing \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; with the branch you are working on (if you forget what it is called, you can run git status or git branch and copy the branch name from there!):\n  1git push origin \u0026lt;current-branch\u0026gt; 6. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub As we did at the end of last class, let's create a pull request to merge this test-branch to main.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch: on the left side, there should be a button with main and a down arrow -- click this and select your branch. At the top, if there is an option to \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot;, click that, otherwise click on the \u0026quot;Pull request\u0026quot; tab and then \u0026quot;New pull request\u0026quot;.\nSince this is a forked branch, we are given the option of submitting a pull request against the original repository that we forked from (listed under base repository). This is often how you can contribute to open source projects -- by forking the repository, making your changes, and then submitting a PR against the original repo for the maintainers of the project to accept or reject.\nFor now, let's just PR within the fork, so change the base repository to be the forked repo. (The base repository and head repository should match, but the base branch should be main).\nAssign someone in your group to the PR 'it can be seen in the right section and approve and merge the changes into main.\n7. (Optional) Let¬¥s swap places Now it is time for your partner to repeat what you have done.\nBUT! instead of forking the repository we will clone directly your partner repository so both of you can contribute towards a shared journal.\nFor that let¬¥s do the following:\n Ask your partner for an URL pointing to his journal repository that both of you have created and existts in Github. Let¬¥s clone the repository (make sure the Pull Request opened is merged and that the main branch has the content you just created) Add some new files, folders, images and after add, commit and push your changes. You can go back to section 3 and repeat the same instructions  Extra resources  Git online VSCode Crash course VS Basics   VSCODE CHEATSHEET Install an extension Installing an extension\nCreating a new folder To create a folder we first need to click on the left sidebar the explorer icon.
