      <description>Pre Requisites  Look into the three Python installation options below (under Python Installation Overview). Spend some time thinking about which option may make sense for you. VSCode or PyCharm will give you the most options and would enable you to continue practicing your command line and git/GitHub skills. Ideally, try getting set up with at least one of the options. We will then troubleshoot and go through this in class for folks who ran into any issues with their setup.</description>
