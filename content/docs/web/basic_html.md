## Lesson Goal

Understand what HTML is, why we use it and create a HTML-based journal with links and graphics

## HTML - What is it?


It makes up the structure and content of any webpage and tells it how it should look strucure wise.
![html-css-js-anology](https://scontent-frt3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/119026861_1499182456955951_7652532436839803427_n.png?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=kOh4c0z6WA4AX9c1tQm&_nc_oc=AQlhWYWIIcB1qs850n4o6wnk2pyFr_6Xy4nbRWtGjhkm5gmMWClZj8fijUH1jxmDKVo&_nc_ht=scontent-frt3-2.xx&oh=00_AT-Qw_Cd9W4Fb2qmXywVYTmYjVrfZ6PC2NNNqEs9HRaosw&oe=6284AFFF)

→ `HyperText Markup Language`, is a markup language (not a programming language!) designed to be displayed in a Web Browser. 


![html-intro-image](https://d6x8u9i2.rocketcdn.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/http.png)

→ When you type in an address (url) your computer makes a request to a server and asks for this specific website (`get request`) and the server talks through http (`hyper text transfer protocol`) and responds with the html code.


## How to get started?
> Review [Starting a brand new project](../../git/git_and_github_desktop) from the Version Control with Git and GitHub lecture

→ We'll use github to store the HTML files we create in this lecture and idealy publish our first website using the `gitHub pages` hosting later on.


In your desired folder/repository create an `index.html` file.
Why call it _index_? When your browser downloads the website files from a server, it immediately searches for a first file to open and display - by default, the browser will look for a file named "index". Therefore it is common practice to have this file containing the homepage.

## Structure of HTML Documents

#### HTML Skeleton
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Page's intelligence (meta data) -->
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <!-- Actual page content (displayed in browser) -->
     <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

<details>
  <summary>What is the meaning of each of these lines?! 📖 </summary>
  
  1. The page is defined as an HTML document:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```
  1. The `html`tag represents the root of the document, all other elements need to go inside these tags:
  ```html
  <html>
    ...
  </html>
  ```
  3. The intelligence of a page is placed between the `head`tags (like meta data, link to stylesheets and so on)
  ```html
  <head>
    <!-- Page's intelligence (meta data) -->
    ...
  </head>
  ```
  5. A title is added to the tab:
  ```html
  <title> This is a title </title>
  ```
  5. The visual website content will be contained within the `body`. Right now it contains only a header saying Hello, World!:
  ```html
  <body>
     <!-- Actual page content (displayed in browser) -->
     <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
  ```
</details>

<br>

→ To create the basic skeleton use a snippet: simply type `!` in an empty `.html` file and hit enter.

The set of all opening and closing tags in a HTML document form a hierarchy (just like a tree). For example in the  HTML markup above, the `<html>` tag is the parent of the `<head>` and `<body>` tags. The `<title>` tag is a child of the `<head>` tag and a grandchild of the `<html>` tag.


<br>

#### Elements & Tags
![test](https://sts.doit.wisc.edu/manuals/html/images/basics-structure-1.png)
→ the whole thing is called an **element** (opening tag + content + closing tag)\
→ elements tell the browser how to display the content (default styling - can be overwritten with CSS)

There are also **self-closing tags** (do not need a closing tag), the most common ones are `img` and `input`
```html
<!-- Examples of self-closing tags -->

<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" alt="random image from unsplash">

<input type="email">

<!-- The closing slash is optional -->
<input type="email" />
```

<br>

#### Attributes and Values
![test](https://sts.doit.wisc.edu/manuals/html/images/basics-structure-2.png)

As you can see above in the code example, tags can take certain attributes and values inside the opening tag.

<br>

#### Nesting Elements
Elements can be placed inside other elements, which is called nesting.

→ make sure to always indent properly (opening and closing tag on same level), otherwise when the page gets larger, nesting can become complicated and errors are more likely to occur (missing closing tags, wrong nesting and so on)
````html
<!-- WRONG ❌ hard to read and prone for errors -->
<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
<li>Orange</li>
    <li>Banana</li><li>Strawberry
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- CORRECT ✅ -->
<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Strawberry</li>
</ul>

````
<br>

#### Block vs. Inline Elements
![Block vs. Inline Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.17.22-PM.png)

Most elements are (by default) `block` like **headers**, **paragraphs**, **divs**, **lists** → there is a line break after each element.
Some elements like **links**, **images** and **spans** are `inline` → they do not start on a new line and only occupy the space they need.
