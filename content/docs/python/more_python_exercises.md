## 1. Recap
→ Data Types we have learned about so far are Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Lists and Dictionaries


```python
# Strings
"Hello World" # 'Hello World' (double or single quotation marks)
# Numbers
1
1.5
# Booleans
True
False
# Lists
[1, 2, 3]
['Hello', 'World']
# Dictionaries
{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
```

→ we usually store data in variables through the use of the = operator (therefore called assignment operator)

```python
# Assign a value to a variable
name = 'John'
# Print the value of the variable
print(name)
# Print the type of the variable
print(type(name))
```


→ If-else statements are used to control the flow of your code.
```python
if condition:
  # do something
elif condition:
  # do something
else:
  # do something
```

→ with the help of the `for` loop we can for example iterate over a list.
```python
for item in list:
  # do something
```

## 2. Goal for today
→ Get more comfortable with Python basics.

→ Learn how to google for certain methods and ideas.

## 3. Exercises 

Go to this [link](https://github.com/hannah-eichelsdoerfer/python_practice) to get todays exercises - clone the repository.

1. Open the folder called "Exercises" and start working on the challenges in the `strings.py` file.
2. Continue working on the challenges in the `lists.py` file.
3. Move on to working on the challenges in the `dictionaries.py` file.
