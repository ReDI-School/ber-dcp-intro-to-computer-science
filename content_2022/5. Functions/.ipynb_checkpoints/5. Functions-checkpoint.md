## Lesson Goal

Have a high-level idea of what Python is and start getting comfortable reading and writing basic statements in this programming language.



### Functions

- What is a **function**?

  ```python
  def my_test_function(a):
      return a
  ```

  A **function** is a sequence of steps or tasks (written in a block of code), which may or may not take in _arguments_. Whenever we _call_ a function, we execute this defined set of steps (with any _arguments_ passed in). The above example function takes in some value and simply _returns_, or gives us back, this value when we _call_ it like so: `my_test_function(12) # evaluates to 12`

### Task 1: create and call a function that prints "Hello, World!"

{{< tip >}}
Tip: Modify the code you wrote in the previous task so that this happens within a function that you define.
{{< /tip >}}

<!-- A Solution:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Let's call the function
hello_world()
``` -->

### Task 2: create a function that returns the string "Hello, World!". Call this function and print the output.

A solution:

```python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"

print(hello_world())
```

### Task 3: modify your function so you can greet a specific name: "Hello, Person"

In other words:

```python
my_hello_world("Noor")
# expected output -> "Hello, Noor"
```

<!-- A solution:

```python
def hello_world(name):
    return ("Hello, " + name)

print(hello_world("Noor"))
# output -> "Hello, Noor"
print(hello_world("Jose"))
# output -> "Hello, Jose"
```

Another solution:

```python
def hello_world(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

hello_world("Noor")
# output -> "Hello, Noor"
hello_world("Jose")
# output -> "Hello, Jose"
``` -->

### Additional practice (all optional)

- Modify your "greeter" using any of the concepts we discussed; perhaps include a conditional expression (i.e. only greet IF ...).
- Try to write and evaluate any Python expressions that you saw in the silent teacher activity in the playground.
- Write your own function to return or print some value.

### Task 18 - Functions

A function lets us create a set of instructions that we can run when needed. Functions are essential in Python and in many other programming languages. They help us create meaningful programs, because they allow us to decompose a program into manageable parts, and they promote readability and code reuse.

Here is an example function:

```py
def greet(name):
    print('Hello,', name)
```

This is the function definition. There is a `def` keyword, so that the Python interpreter knows that this is a function `def`inition, function name (`greet`), arguments (`name` in this case), and a body (the set of instructions, which is the part that follows the colon and is indented one level on the left).

To run this function, we must call it. This is the syntax to call the function: `greet('Rami')`
We can execute this function as many times as we want to.

The name of the function, hello, is very important. It should be descriptive,
so anyone calling it can imagine what the function does.

- Write a function called `was_it_sunny` that takes in a boolean argument `it_was`, that prints "yes" if the parameter value was True and "no" otherwise. Call this function twice, once with the value `True` and once with `False`, and print the outputs of these calls.
- Write a function that takes in 3 values and returns a list containing those three values.

# output -> "Hello, Jose"
``` -->

```python
print("hello word")

a="hello word"
print(a)

def redi():
    print("hello word")
redi()

def my_function():
    print("Hello world from a function")
my_function()

def my_function2(a):
    print("Function calls",a)
my_function2(a)
```

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    area = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
    return area

area1 = calculate_area(10)
area2 = calculate_area(20)

print(area1, area2)
```

```python
def calculate_area(radius): # parameters are local variables
    area = pi * (radius ** 2)  # local variable, is not visible
                               # outside of the function
                               # and shadows global variable with the same name
    return area


pi = 3.14  # global variable - is visible in function if defined
           # before the first call of the function (try to move it
           # after the first call of calculate_area function )

area = 100  # global variable with the same name as local one in function

area1 = calculate_area(10)
area2 = calculate_area(20)

print(area1, area2)
print(area) # prints the one of the closest scope
print(radius) # Error here, there is no radius variable in the global scope
```

## 3. Hands-on Python Tasks

**Work in groups** to solve the following tasks in your Python Dev setup. As a group exercise, we expect you to discuss with your group members to **solve the problems together**. This may mean having one person share their screen and talking through the code you will write together, and making sure you all understand before moving on to the next task. You are **not expected** to get through all of these in class, and they range from easier to harder. We will continue working on these exercises in the next session as well.

To build on the skills that we have learned earlier in the semester, if working in VSCode or PyCharm, please create a new repository and commit your changes as you go. You can check out the reference sheets to help remember the necessary git and command line commands. [Click here for the cheat sheet](../../references)

Optionally, you may send in a link to a GitHub repository with your solutions (if working in VSCode or PyCharm) or share your notebook (if working in Colab) if you would like feedback on your work :)

Note: if you are writing in Colab or a Python Notebook, then try to keep each task in a separate code cell. If you are writing in a pure Python file, consider wrapping each task in a function (that is, write a function to solve the task) and call these functions in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to test out your code. This might look something like:

```python
# in your file:
def task_n(a, b):
    # code to solve task 1
    ...

    return answer_to_task_n

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(task_n(1, 2))  # prints output of task_n

```

Note: it can be helpful to test out your functions by making sure that the functions return what you expect for a few different inputs. Make sure to try out a variety of inputs including some "edge cases", or cases that are trickier and can cause problems. These edge cases often have to do with "0" or empty-inputs.
(Optional): In Python, you can also write `assert` statements, where you would state what you believe the function to output to be, and it fails if this is not the case.

Let's use an example task 0 to illustrate all the points above.

### Task 0 (warmup)

Write a function called `add_10` that takes in an _integer_, adds 10, and returns this value.
Test out these steps and make sure you feel comfortable with the process. The following tasks won't have a walk through, but you should follow the same rough process.

Steps:

1. Write out your _function skeleton_, or the empty function with the name and parameters. (Note: `n` is commonly used to denote a number, but you can also write more descriptive variable names):

```python
def add_10(n):
    # TODO: add logic to add 10
    return "Not implemented"
```

2. Let's call this function somewhere so we can see what it's outputting.
   In a `.py` file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the text is not required, but it helps me see what I called to get the output
    print("add_10(3): ", add_10(3))  # for now, this returns "add_10(3): Not implemented"

```

3. Let's add in some logic and check the values that it is outputting. If these values don't match your expectations (which often happens in programming), then take another look and try to understand what's going wrong. You can add `print` statements in your code as well to tell you what the values of different variables and conditions are while you are running your code. You should feel encouraged to look things up when you run into issues as well.

```python
def add_10(n):
    return n + 10

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("add_10(3): ", add_10(3))  # this should now print "add_10(3): 13"
    print("add_10(-10): ", add_10(-10))  # this should now print "add_10(-10): 0"

```

4. Optional: you can also use `assert` statements to confirm your expectations. This is a way of writing simple "test cases" to make sure your logic works. This looks something like:

```python
def add_10(n):
    return n + 10

if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert add_10(3) == 13
    assert add_10(-10) == 0
    assert add_10(0) == 10

```

What happens if the assert statement is wrong? (Hint: try out something like `assert add_10(3) == 5` which we expect to fail and see what happens.)

You can also add this in to a test function to organize your code:

```python
def add_10(n):
    return n + 10

def test_add_10():
    assert add_10(3) == 13
    assert add_10(-10) == 0
    assert add_10(0) == 10


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_add_10()  # expect no output if all assertions passed

```

### Task 1

Write a function called `longer_string` that takes in two _strings_ and returns the longer of the two. If they are the same length, return the first string.

### Task 2

Write a function called `is_odd` that takes in an _integer_ and returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` otherwise.

{{< tip >}}
Hint: look up (Google) what the modulo (`%`) operator in Python is and use it to determine if a number is odd or even.
{{< /tip >}}

### Task 3 (parts 1, 2)

Write a function called `hello_world_n` that takes in an integer `n` and prints "Hello, world!" `n` times.

1. do this using a `for` loop
2. do this using a `while` loop

### Task 4

Write a function called `sum_list` that takes in a list of integers (i.e. `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`) and returns the sum of them. Do not use the `sum` function in your logic, but you can use this to test your logic! (Hint: `assert sum(lst) == ...`)

### Task 5

Write a function that takes in a list of integers (i.e. `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`) and prints the value of each element greater than 4.
For example:

- input: `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`
  ```python
  # output:
  # 10
  # 5
  ```
- input: `[4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4]`

  ```python
  # output:
  # 5
  # 6
  # 6
  # 5
  ```

- input: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`

  ```python
  # no output
  ```

{{< tip >}}
Optional Challenge: change your function to take in a second parameter, `min_val`. Now, print all values in the list greater than this value.

Example input: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, `2`

```python
    # output:
    # 4
    # 3
```

{{< /tip >}}

### (Challenge) Task 6 (parts 1, 2)

_Note: this one is optional and meant to be challenging! :)_

Like with task 4, do not use the Python function `max` in your function, but you can use this to test it out!

1. Write a function that takes in a list of integers (i.e. `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`) and returns largest value in the list.
2. Write a function that takes in a list of strings (i.e. `['a', 'asdf', '']`) and returns the longest string in the list.

### (Challenge) Task 7 (parts 1, 2, 3)

_Note: this one is optional and meant to be challenging! :)_

1. Write a function that takes in an integer and prints all numbers below it that are divisible by 3. (Hint: recall Task 2 -- how can you check if a number is divisible by 3?)

   Example input: `12`

   ```python
   # output:
   # 0
   # 3
   # 6
   # 9
   ```

2) Modify the function to return how many numbers are divisible by 3, in addition to printing each number. (i.e. the returned value for the example input above would be `4` (0, 3, 6, 9)).
3) Modify this function to make it general -- if the function takes in `n` and `k`, find out how many numbers less than `n` are divisible by `k`.

   Example input: `8`, `2`

   ```python
   # output:
   # 0
   # 2
   # 4
   # 6
   # returns 4
   ```

### Additional practice (all optional)

- Modify your "greeter" using any of the concepts we discussed; perhaps include a conditional expression (i.e. only greet IF ...).
- Try to write and evaluate any Python expressions that you saw in the silent teacher activity in the playground.
- Write your own function to return or print some value.
