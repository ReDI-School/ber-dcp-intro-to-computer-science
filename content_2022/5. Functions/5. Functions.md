## Lesson Goal

Have a high-level idea of what Python is and start getting comfortable reading and writing basic statements in this programming language.



### Functions

- What is a **function**?
- A function lets us create a set of instructions that we can run when needed. Functions are essential in Python and in many other programming languages. They help us create meaningful programs, because they allow us to decompose a program into manageable parts, and they promote readability and code reuse.

  ```python
  def my_test_function(a):
      return a
  ```

  A **function** is a sequence of steps or tasks (written in a block of code), which may or may not take in `argument`. Whenever we _call_ a function, we execute this defined set of steps (with any _arguments_ passed in). The above example function takes in some value and simply _returns_, or gives us back, this value when we _call_ it like so: `my_test_function(12) # evaluates to 12`


```python
#1. print a string
print("hello word")

#2. print a string via variable
a="hello word"
print(a)

#3. print a string via function
def redi():
    print("hello world")
redi()
```

### Exercise 1: create and call a function that prints "Hello, World!"


*Hint: Modify the code you wrote in the previous task so that this happens within a function that you define.*


<!-- A Solution:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Let's call the function
hello_world()
``` -->

### Exercise 2: create a function that returns the string "Hello, World!". Call this function and print the output.

<!--A solution:

```python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"

print(hello_world())
``` -->



### Exercise 3: modify your function so you can greet a specific name: "Hello, Person"

In other words:

```python
greet("Nesli")
# expected output -> "Hello, Nesli"
```

<!-- A solution:

```python
def hello_world(name):
    return ("Hello, " + name)

print(hello_world("Noor"))
# output -> "Hello, Noor"
print(hello_world("Jose"))
# output -> "Hello, Jose"
```

Another solution:

```python
def hello_world(name):
    print("Hello, " , name)

hello_world("Noor")
# output -> "Hello, Noor"
hello_world("Jose")
# output -> "Hello, Jose"
``` -->

### Exercise 3 - Solution

```py
def greet(name):
    print('Hello, ', name)
```
or 

```py
def greet(name):
    print('Hello, ' + name)
```

### Function terms

There is a `def` keyword, so that the Python interpreter knows that this is a function `def`inition, function name (`greet`), arguments (`name` in this case), and a body (the set of instructions, which is the part that follows the colon and is indented one level on the left).

To run this function, we must call it. This is the syntax to call the function: `greet('Nesli')`
We can execute this function as many times as we want to.

The name of the function, `greet`, is very important. It should be descriptive,
so anyone calling it can imagine what the function does.

#### Parameters or Arguments

The terms `parameter` and `argument` can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function. 

**From a function's perspective:**

A `parameter` is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

```py
def greet(name):
    print('Hello, ' + name)
```
Above `name` is a parameter.

An `argument` is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

```py
greet("Nesli")
```
Above `Nesli` is an argument.

**Number of Arguments**
- You must call the function with the number of arguments that your function expects (number of parameters that you defined), **not less, not more!!**

```py
def full_name(firstname, lastname): #2 parameters
    print(firstname + " " + lastname)

full_name("Neslihan", "Keskin") #2 arguments

Output: "Neslihan Keskin"
```
### Exercise 4: 
- Write a Python function called max_of_two expects two integer returns the bigger number. 

```py
def max_of_two( x, y ):
    if x > y:
        return x
    return y
```

### Exercise 5: 
- Create a function called `your_age` that expects an `age` argument and returns "you are young" if age is less than 30, otherwise "your sipirit is still young ;)
"
- Call this function twice, once with the value less than 30 and once with higher than 30 and print the outputs of these calls.

```py
def your_age(age):
    if age < 30:
        print("you are young")
    else:
        print("your sipirit is still young ;)")

your_age(25)
your_age(40)
```
- Modify the function by using `input` ask user to enter an age and apply the same logic above.

```py
def your_age():
    age=int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if age < 30:
        print("you are young")
    else:
        print("your sipirit is still young ;)")

your_age()
```

### Exercise 6: create a function that return circle area by given its radius as an argument.

*Hint:*
Formula: **" circle area = 3.14 * radius<sup>2</sup> "**

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    area = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
    return area

area1 = calculate_area(10)
area2 = calculate_area(20)

print(area1, area2)
```

```python
def calculate_area(radius): # parameters are local variables
    area = pi * (radius ** 2)  # local variable, is not visible
                               # outside of the function
                               # and shadows global variable with the same name
    return area


pi = 3.14  # global variable - is visible in function if defined
           # before the first call of the function (try to move it
           # after the first call of calculate_area function )

area = 100  # global variable with the same name as local one in function

area1 = calculate_area(10)
area2 = calculate_area(20)

print(area1, area2)
print(area) # prints the one of the closest scope
print(radius) # Error here, there is no radius variable in the global scope
```
### Exercise 7: function with for loop
- Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.

```python
def summ(numbers):
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    return total

num_list=[4,5,7,2,-8]
summ(num_list)
```

<!--
### Function in Py file
If you are writing in a pure Python file, consider wrapping each task in a function (that is, write a function to solve the task) and call these functions in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to test out your code. This might look something like:

```python
# in your file:
def task_n(a, b):
    # code to solve task 1
    ...

    return answer_to_task_n

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(task_n(1, 2))  # prints output of task_n

```

Note: it can be helpful to test out your functions by making sure that the functions return what you expect for a few different inputs. Make sure to try out a variety of inputs including some "edge cases", or cases that are trickier and can cause problems. These edge cases often have to do with "0" or empty-inputs.

(Optional): In Python, you can also write `assert` statements, where you would state what you believe the function to output to be, and it fails if this is not the case.

Let's use an example task 0 to illustrate all the points above.

### Exercise 8

Write a function called `add_10` that takes in an _integer_, adds 10, and returns this value.
Test out these steps and make sure you feel comfortable with the process. The following tasks won't have a walk through, but you should follow the same rough process.

Steps:

1. Write out your _function skeleton_, or the empty function with the name and parameters. (Note: `n` is commonly used to denote a number, but you can also write more descriptive variable names):

```python
def add_10(n):
    # TODO: add logic to add 10
    return "Not implemented"
```

2. Let's call this function somewhere so we can see what it's outputting.
   In a `.py` file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the text is not required, but it helps me see what I called to get the output
    print("add_10(3): ", add_10(3))  # for now, this returns "add_10(3): Not implemented"

```

3. Let's add in some logic and check the values that it is outputting. If these values don't match your expectations (which often happens in programming), then take another look and try to understand what's going wrong. You can add `print` statements in your code as well to tell you what the values of different variables and conditions are while you are running your code. You should feel encouraged to look things up when you run into issues as well.

```python
def add_10(n):
    return n + 10

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("add_10(3): ", add_10(3))  # this should now print "add_10(3): 13"
    print("add_10(-10): ", add_10(-10))  # this should now print "add_10(-10): 0"

```

4. Optional: you can also use `assert` statements to confirm your expectations. This is a way of writing simple "test cases" to make sure your logic works. This looks something like:

```python
def add_10(n):
    return n + 10

if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert add_10(3) == 13
    assert add_10(-10) == 0
    assert add_10(0) == 10

```

What happens if the assert statement is wrong? (Hint: try out something like `assert add_10(3) == 5` which we expect to fail and see what happens.)

You can also add this in to a test function to organize your code:

```python
def add_10(n):
    return n + 10

def test_add_10():
    assert add_10(3) == 13
    assert add_10(-10) == 0
    assert add_10(0) == 10


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_add_10()  # expect no output if all assertions passed

```  -->

## Hands-on Python Tasks

**Work in groups** to solve the following tasks in your Python Dev setup. As a group exercise, we expect you to discuss with your group members to **solve the problems together**. This may mean having one person share their screen and talking through the code you will write together, and making sure you all understand before moving on to the next task. You are **not expected** to get through all of these in class, and they range from easier to harder. It is okay not to complete all the tasks during the class, but please continue as a homework.

To build on the skills that we have learned earlier in the semester, if working in VSCode or Jupyter Lab, please create a new repository and commit your changes as you go. You can check out the reference sheets to help remember the necessary git and command line commands. [Click here for the cheat sheet](../../references)

Optionally, you may send in a link to a GitHub repository with your solutions (if working in VSCode or Jupter Lab) or share your notebook (if working in Colab) if you would like feedback on your work :)

Note: if you are writing in Colab or a Python Notebook, then try to keep each task in a separate code cell. 

### Task 1 (part 1, 2)

1.  Write your own function called `my_function` that returns the string `Hello, this is my first function` .
2.  Write your own function called `my_function` that expects a parameter called `message` and returns the `message`. Called the function with the argument called `my_message` that you assigned the string `Hello, this is my first function` .

### Task 2  (part 1, 2)
1. Write a function called `area` that calculates area of square by given edge length (s)
2. Modify your function that it calculates square area by asking user for the edge of length (s) using input function. 

*Hint:*
- Formula: **" square area = s<sup>2</sup> "**
- Don’t forget that input function returns strings that should be converted to numbers

### Task 3 
 You are in a country X and travelling to Germany next week. You have 100 dollars and you want to convert them to euros. You go to a currency exchange center and they tell you that they cannot convert it directly: they have first to convert the 100 dollars to currency X, and then convert it from currency X to euros. Write a program which asks an amount to the user, makes a conversion of 100 dollars to euro and prints the result, given that:

- exchange rate from dollars to currency X is 15 (1 dollar become 15X)
- exchange rate from currency X to euros is 0.05 (1 X become 0.05 Euros)

*Hints:*

- Ask the user for the amount of dollars using input function and save the user’s input into a variable called `amount`. Don’t forget that input function returns strings that should be converted to numbers.
- Create two variables for conversion rates
- Multiply the amount of dollars by conversion rate from dollars to currency X and then multiply the result by conversion rate from currency X to euros
- Output the result using function print

### Task 4 
- Create a function called `circle` which asks the user for a radius of a circle, and outputs the area and circumference of that circle.

*Hints:*

- Ask the user for a radius using input function and save the user’s input into a variable called `radius`. Don’t forget that input function returns strings that should be converted to numbers (floating-point in this case) for arithmetic operations.
- Calculate the area using the formula: S = 3.14 radius radius and store the result in a variable.
- Calculate the circumference using the formula: L = 2 3.14 radius and store the result in a variable.
- Output both results using function print. You can try to print the answer in a form: “The area is X, the circumference is Y”, where is X is the calculated area and Y is the calculated circumference - function print can output as many values as you want.

### Task 5 - with if condition

- Create a function called `big number` which asks the user for two integer numbers and prints the bigger one.

*Hints:*

- Ask the user for a first number using input function and save the user’s input into a variable. Don’t forget that input function returns strings that should be converted to numbers (integer in this case).
- Ask the user for a second number using input function and save the user’s input into a variable. Don’t forget that input function returns strings that should be converted to numbers (integer in this case).
- Using the conditionals (if-else construction) output either first or second variable depending on which one is bigger. To define a condition use comparison operators (operator > in this case)


### Task 6 - with if condition
- Write a function called `was_it_sunny` that takes in a boolean argument `it_was`
- The function prints "yes" if the parameter value was True and "no" otherwise. 
- Call this function twice, once with the value `True` and once with `False`, and print the outputs of these calls.

### Task 7 - with nested if

- Create a function called `timefor` which asks the user for the current hour (a number from 0 to 23). Depending on the user’s input, the program should print:

    - “It’s breakfast time” if the hour is between 7 and 11
    - “It’s lunch time” if the hour is between 12 and 16
    - “It’s dinner time” if the hour is between 17 and 22
    - “It’s sleeping time” if the hour is between 23 and 6 What if user enters a negative number like -1 or big number like 53? Try to handle this situation in your program

*Hints:*

- Ask the user for a hour using input function and save the user’s input into a variable. Don’t forget that input function returns strings that should be converted to numbers (integer in this case).
- Using the conditionals (if-elif-else construction) output either of four lines depending on the result of comparison of the number given by the user to the given numbers (7, 11, 16, 22)
- To ensure that the user input is correct (the number is between 0 and 23) you can use another conditional right after user’s input: if the number is within the given interval - program continues, otherwise - prints the error message and finishes.


### Task 8 - with for loop
- Create a list with the first names of your breakout room group, and assign this to the variable called `first_names`.
- Modify your "greet" function, that returns for each name in `first_names` with sting Hello , "Hello, name"

 *Hint: Use for loop*

### Task 9
- Write a function that takes in 3 values (apple, banana, cherry) and returns a list containing those three values.


### Task 10 - with if condition

Write a function called `longer_string` that takes in two _strings_ and returns the longer of the two. If they are the same length, return the first string.

### Task 11 - with if condition

Write a function called `is_odd` that takes in an _integer_ and returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` otherwise.

*Hint: look up what the modulo (`%`) operator in Python is and use it to determine if a number is odd or even. Remember the exercise in previous lesson below*

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) # Declaring the tuple
count_odd = 0
count_even = 0
even=[]
odd=[]
for x in numbers:
        if not x % 2:
            count_even+=1
            print("Even", x)  
        else:
            count_odd+=1
            print("Odd",x)                  
print("Number of even numbers :",count_even)
print("Number of odd numbers :",count_odd)
```

### Task 12 (parts 1, 2) - with for and while loop

Write a function called `hello_world_n` that takes in an integer `n` and prints "Hello, world!" `n` times.

1. do this using a `for` loop
2. do this using a `while` loop

### Task 13 - with for loop

Write a function called `sum_list` that takes in a list of integers (i.e. `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`) and returns the sum of them. Do not use the `sum` function in your logic, but you can use this to test your logic! (Hint: `assert sum(lst) == ...`)

### Task 14 - with if and for

- Write a function called `sentenceandword` which asks to the user a text and a word, and remove from the text all the letters that appear in the word, then prints it

Example:

tell me a sentence: The cat is on the table
tell me a word: apple
Result: Th ct is on th tb
Hint: To check whether a letter is into a string, you can use in:

print('p' in 'apple') # True


*Hints:*

- Ask the user for a sentence using input function and save the user’s input into a variable called `sentence`.
- Ask the user for a word using input function and save the user’s input into a variable called `word`.
- Use for loop to iterate every letter in the sentence
- Use if condition to check wether the letter exists in the word.
- Print out not existed letters as the output of the function


### Task 15 - with if and for
- Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list. 

Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]

### Task 16 (parts 1, 2)

1. Write a function called `greater` that takes in a list of integers (i.e. `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`) and prints the value of each element greater than 4.
For example:

- input: `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`
  ```python
  # output:
  # 10
  # 5
  ```
- input: `[4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4]`

  ```python
  # output:
  # 5
  # 6
  # 6
  # 5
  ```

- input: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`

  ```python
  # no output
  ```


2. change your function to take in a second parameter, `min_val`. Now, print all values in the list greater than this value.

Example input: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, `2`

```python
    # output:
    # 4
    # 3
```

_Note: Bonus questions are optional and meant to be challenging! :)_

### Bonus 0 (parts 1, 2)

_Note: this one is optional and meant to be challenging! :)_

Like with task 10, do not use the Python function `max` in your function, but you can use this to test it out!

1. Write a function called `largest` that takes in a list of integers (i.e. `[3, 0, 10, 4, 5, 3]`) and returns largest value in the list.
2. Write a function called `longest` that takes in a list of strings (i.e. `['a', 'asdf', '']`) and returns the longest string in the list.



### Bonus 1 (parts 1, 2, 3) 


1. Write a function that takes in an integer and prints all numbers below it that are divisible by 3. (Hint: recall Task 2 -- how can you check if a number is divisible by 3?)

   Example input: `12`

   ```python
   # output:
   # 0
   # 3
   # 6
   # 9
   ```

2) Modify the function to return how many numbers are divisible by 3, in addition to printing each number. (i.e. the returned value for the example input above would be `4` (0, 3, 6, 9)).
3) Modify this function to make it general -- if the function takes in `n` and `k`, find out how many numbers less than `n` are divisible by `k`.

   Example input: `8`, `2`

   ```python
   # output:
   # 0
   # 2
   # 4
   # 6
   # returns 4
   ```
### Bonus 2
- Write a program which asks to the user a list of words and prints the words appearing more than once

Example:

Input: three bottle bag park cup bag hammer

Output: bag

*Hint: To get a list of strings, you can use split and pass a space:*

- words = input('tell me some words').split(' ') 

*Remember: you can sort lists of strings, not only numbers!*
### Bonus 3
- Write a function that takes as input a list of strings and returns the longest string

Example:

    - Input: ['hello', 'check', 'amazing']
    - Output: 'amazing'
    - Input: ['lol', 'wow', 'great']
    - Output: 'great'
### Bonus 4
- Write a function that gets a number n as input and it prints all numbers from 1 till n on one line. 

Example:

    - Input: 5,
    - Output (displayed): 1 2 3 4 5
    - Input: 3
    - Output (displayed): 1 2 3
### Bonus 5

- Write a function that takes a number n as input and prints a pyramid of numbers as in the examples below

    - Input: 4
    - Output: 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4
