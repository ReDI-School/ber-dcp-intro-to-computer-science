# Python Tool Setup and Installation


## 1 Tools Setup

Before we  start programming in python, we need to install the required tools used for running python code. Since python is the major language used for data science, some of the installed tools can also be used for data science projests. **The installation guide is focus on Windows OS**, the steps may be a bit different for MacOS and Linux.  We will cover the setup and installation of the following tools:
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Windows Terminal
- Git
- Miniconda / Conda & Python
- Visual Studio Code
- JupyterLab

**If you use a Unix based OS(MacOS and Linux), you can skip the installation of Windows Subsystem and Windows Terminal**


### 1.1 Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WSL enables us to use a Linux distribution operating system with Linux tools on our Windows machines in a completely integrated manner (no need to dual-boot).
When we install a Linux distribution with WSL, we are installing a new file system, separated from the Windows NTFS C:\ drive.

**Documentation**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

#### 1.1.1 Installing WSL

**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

- Search for Command Prompt(PowerSheell) on your computer Open PowerShell
- Right click on it and run as an administrator 
- Run the following command in your command prompt 

```wsl --install -d Ubuntu``` 

This will install WSL together with an Ubuntu distribution on your computer. You may need to reboot your to make the installation take effect.

- Once you have installed WSL, you should now have Ubuntu in your Windows Start Menu. Open Ubuntu from the Windows start menu (if it has not opened automatically after installation). We can also pin Ubuntu to your Windows taskbar for easy accessibility in the future. 

**Note: If you can't find Ubuntu in your Windows start Menu after installation, please restart your computer** 

- You will now be prompted to create a user account and password for your newly installed Linux distribution. This account will be considered the Linux administrator, with the ability to run sudo (Super User Do) administrative commands.

- We can now interact with our Ubuntu distribution through the bash console that was launched.

#### 1.1.2 Set up a WSL development environment

**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment)

- Upgrade your packages using the apt package manager by running ```sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade``` in the launched bash console.

- You can open the new file system that comes with our Ubuntu distribution by leveraging the Windows explorer. To do this, enter the home directory and start the explorer executable from your Bash console as follows:

```cd ~```
```explorer.exe .```

### 1.2 Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal is a modern application that allows the use of many command-line shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell and bash (via Windows Subsystem for Linux) in a beautiful customizable terminal with features such as multiple tabs and panes, Unicode and UTF-8 character support and a GPU accelerated text rendering engine.

**Documentation**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/)

#### 1.2.1 Installing Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store
**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)

- Install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store by following this link: [https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=de-de&gl=DE](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=de-de&gl=DE).
- Once Windows Terminal is installed, search for Terminal in the Windows start menu and start the application. We can also pin Terminal to our Windows taskbar for easy accessibility in the future.

#### 1.2.2 Set up Windows Terminal

- Configure "Ubuntu" as your Startup Default profile as described in [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install#set-your-default-terminal-profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install#set-your-default-terminal-profile).

### 1.3 Git

Git enables us to version control our files and track changes so that we have a nicely structured recorded history and don't need to duplicate files to save different versions in an intransparent way. It also gives us the ability to easily revert to previous versions of files and makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to be merged into a common repository.
#### 1.3.1 Iinstalling Git

Run the following command to install git based on your OS 

**Linux - Ubuntu distribution**
```sudo apt install git-all```

**Linux - Fedora, CentOS, RHEL and other RPM-based distribution**
```sudo dnf install git-all```

**macOS**
```brew install git```

**Windows**

**Install Git in WSL**
**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git)

- Run the following from your bash command line interface (inside Windows Terminal) to install the latest stable Git version:
```sudo apt-get install git```. 
- Run ```git --version```.

**Alternative**
Download git from [link to download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Install git with the downloaded file 

For more information on how to install git check [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) 

#### 1.3.2 Testing Git installation

To confirm you have installed git, run the following coommand on you terminal

```git --version```

If it output some numbers which represent the version of git you installed, this confirms git is installed


**Documentation**: [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)

#### 1.3.3 Register a GitHub Account


- If you don't yet have a GitHub account, sign up [here](https://github.com/).


#### 1.3.4 Git Config File Setup

- To set up the Git config file, run on your terminal:

```git config --global user.name "<YOUR_NAME>"``` and replace <YOUR_NAME> with your Github Account user name.

- Then run ```git config --global user.email "<YOUR_EMAIL>"``` and replace <YOUR_EMAIL> with your Github Account email.

- If you need to edit the Git config, you can use the text editor nano as follows:

```nano ~/.gitconfig```. When you are done, save the changes with CTRL + X  -> Y -> Enter.

#### 1.3.5 Getting ReDI course repo

- From the bash command line interface in your Windows Terminal or on your terminal for other OS  run: 

```git clone https://github.com/ReDI-School/hh-dcp-intro-to-computer-science.git```

 This will create a local version of this repository in your computer. **This is needed before we can progress with subsequent steps.**


- Run the command 

```ls``` 

This will list all files and directories in that folder and you should now see a new folder called "hh-dcp-intro-to-computer-science".

- To update your local repository to the most up-to-date status of the remote version, navigate into your repository 

```cd hh-dcp-intro-to-computer-science/content_2023```

 **Note:** you can use the tap key to autocomplete the directory name).
 
 Then 
 
  ```git pull```
  
You should run this command at the start of every lesson to have the up-to-date content.

**More information on Git**
- Udacity has a very good free course about Git essentials [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123). In general, we would strongly advise to use Git for version control for your future coding projects. 


### 1.4 Miniconda & Python

Miniconda is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python and the packages they depend on as well as a small number of other useful packages including pip, zlib and few others. Anaconda is the world’s most popular open-source Python distribution platform and one of its main components, conda, is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. With conda, we can quickly install, run, and update packages and their dependencies. It allows us to easily create, save, load, and switch between environments on our local computer, thus enabling an isolated, project-specific environment management. Conda was initially created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language. 

**Documentation**: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

#### 1.4.1 Install Miniconda with Python 3.10 in WSL

**Window and Linux**

- In the bash command line interface Terminal (WSL Ubuntu profile), run the following to download the Miniconda installation script

```wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_23.1.0-1-Linux-x86_64.sh```

- Then, run this command to install Miniconda

```bash Miniconda3-py310_23.1.0-1-Linux-x86_64.sh`` and follow the prompts on the installer screens. Answer "yes" to all questions, particularly to whether you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init.

- Afterwards, you can remove the installation command

 ```rm Miniconda3-py310_23.1.0-1-Linux-x86_64.sh```

- To make the installation changes take effect, close and then re-open your terminal window.

- Run the command

 ```conda list``` 
 
 This command is use to verify that conda is now installed. If an output of packages is returned, you are good to go; otherwise it will tell you that the conda command was not found.

**Alternative**
Download the appropriate installer for your OS with the latest python version(Python 3.10) from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

#### 1.4.2 Create the Conda Environment

We will now create our first conda environment to install all required packages and libraies for the lessons. The most reproducible and recommended way to install a conda environment is from an environment definition in a ".yml" file. To this end, the repository that we just cloned in the previous step contains an "environment.yml" file where the Python version as well as all required packages including their respective versions are defined. We can install the conda environment from the "environment.yml" file as follows:

- Navigate to content_2023 folder

```cd hh-dcp-intro-to-computer-science/content_2023```

- Run 

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

This install the conda environment defined in the "environment.yml" file. **Note**: When using WSL, it can happen that Conda fails to connect to the anaconda repo and returns a CondaHTTPError. If that is the case, open the Windows Command Prompt and type ```wsl --shutdown```. This will restart WSL. Then open WSL and try again.

- After the installation is done, run 

```conda env list``` 

This will list all conda environments. Next to the "base" environment, which is installed by default, you should now see the environment named "intro-to-cs".

- We can activate the new environment by running 

```conda activate intro-to-cs```

 We will activate this environment at the beginning of every lesson of Python classes. In your day-to-day work, we recommend to create different conda environments for different projects so that you have isolated environments and don't break things because of incompatability of packages across projects.

- To deactivate the new environment, run 

```conda deactivate intro-to-cs```.

- OPTIONAL: to uninstall the newly installed conda environment, run 

```conda env remove -n intro-to-cs```.

<!-- ### 1.2.5 Azure CLI 

The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a cross-platform command-line tool to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It allows the execution of commands through a terminal using interactive command-line prompts or a script.

**Documentation**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli)

#### 1.2.5.1 Install Azure CLI

**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/cli/azure/install-azure-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

- Run ```curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash``` to install the Azure CLI.

#### 1.2.5.2 Install Azure CLI Azure ML Extension

- Run ```az extension add -n azure-cli-ml``` to install the Azure CLI Azure ML Extension.

### 1.2.6 Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.

**Documentation**: [https://www.terraform.io/](https://www.terraform.io/)

#### 1.2.6.1 Install Terraform

**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

- Run ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common``` to ensure that your system is up to date, and you have the gnupg, software-properties-common, and curl packages installed. You will use these packages to verify HashiCorp's GPG signature, and install HashiCorp's Debian package repository.
- Run ```wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg``` to install the HashiCorp GPG key.
- Run ```gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg --fingerprint``` to verify the key's fingerprint.
- Run ```echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list``` to add the official HashiCorp repository to your system.
- Run ```sudo apt update``` to download the package information from HashiCorp.
- Run ```sudo apt-get install terraform``` to install Terraform from the new repository.

### 1.2.7 Docker

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

**Documentation**: [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)

#### 1.2.7.1 Install Docker

**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://medium.com/geekculture/run-docker-in-windows-10-11-wsl-without-docker-desktop-a2a7eb90556d](https://medium.com/geekculture/run-docker-in-windows-10-11-wsl-without-docker-desktop-a2a7eb90556d)

- Run ```sudo apt update``` to updated the local repository.
- Run ```sudo apt install docker.io -y``` to install Docker.
- Run ```docker --version``` to check the Docker installation.
- Enable automatic start of Docker Daemon on WSL:
    - Modify /etc/sudousers file, which controls how sudo command are executed. We need to make the following modifications to start dockerd without being prompted for a password every time you start a terminal window. Run ```sudo visudo``` and add the following to the bottom of the file: 
        - ```
          # Docker daemon specification
          <USERNAME> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dockerd
          ``` 
          (Please replace `<USERNAME>` with your username).
    - Open the .bashrc file by running ```nano ~/.bashrc```. Then add the following to the bottom of the file:
         -  ```
            # Start Docker daemon automatically when logging in if not running.
            RUNNING=`ps aux | grep dockerd | grep -v grep`
            if [ -z "$RUNNING" ]; then
                sudo dockerd > /dev/null 2>&1 &
                disown
            fi
            ```
    - Add your username to docker group so you can run docker as a non-root user by running ```sudo usermod -aG docker <USERNAME>```. Again, replace `<USERNAME>` with your username.
- Validate the Docker installation by running ```docker run hello-world```.

### 1.5 Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VSCode, is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with support for many languages including Python and has a rich ecosystem of useful extensions, e.g. for working with Git and Azure including a source control tab that will show your changes and handle a variety of git commands for you.. With VSCode we can take advantage of features like Intellisense code completion, linting, debug support, code snippets, and unit testing. Learn more about VS Code's Git support here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support

**Documentation**: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

#### 1.5.1 Install VSCode

**Documentation & Instructions**: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)

- Download  VS code installer file from [VS Code install page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your OS. Then install Visual Studio Code on Windows (not in your WSL file system).


- When prompted to Select Additional Tasks during installation, be sure to check the Add to PATH option so you can easily open a folder in WSL using the code command.

<!-- #### 1.5.2 Install VSCode Remote Development Extension

- Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). This extension pack includes the Remote - WSL extension, in addition to the Remote - SSH, and Remote - Containers extensions, enabling you to open any folder in a container, on a remote machine, or in WSL. -->

#### 1.5.2 Open a WSL project in Visual Studio Code

- Open your Linux distribution's command line via Windows Terminal or just oopen your terminal in other OS and run

 ```code .```
 
  **Note:** it might take some time to install the VS Code Server if you run the command for the first time.

<!-- - You can also access more VS Code Remote options by using the shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+P in VS Code to bring up the command palette. If you then type Remote-WSL you will see a list of the VS Code Remote options available, allowing you to reopen the folder in a remote session, specify which distribution you want to open in, and more. -->
<!-- 
#### 1.5.3 Install Python -->

<!-- - The Remote-WSL extension splits VS Code into a “client-server” architecture, with the client (the user interface) running on your Windows machine and the server (your code, Git, plugins, etc) running remotely in WSL.
- When running VS Code Remote, extensions can therefore be installed either on your local machine or in your WSL distribution (remote). Selecting the 'Extensions' tab will display a list of extensions split between your local machine and your WSL distribution. Extensions for the client (the user interface), like themes, are installed once on your local machine. Installing server extensions on the remote, like the Python extension, or anything that handles things like linting or debugging, must be done separately in your WSL distribution (once in each one if you have multiple). VS Code will display a warning icon ⚠, along with a green "Install in WSL" button, if you have an extension locally installed that is not installed in your WSL. -->
<!-- - Click on extension tab, you can also do that with the keyboard shortcut(Ctrl+Shift+X)
- NSearch for python and install python

ow install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) in your WSL distribution. -->

### 1.6 JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the latest open-source web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. As such, it is one of the most popular tools for Data Scientists. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

**Documentation**: [https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

#### 1.6.1 Run JupyterLab 

- Activate the conda environment by opening your Linux distribution's command line via Windows Terminal or other terminals by running

```conda activate intro-to-cs```

- Run 

```jupyter lab --no-browser``` 

This will launch JupyterLab. Copy the URL, open the browser of your choice on your local workstation (e.g. Google Chrome), and paste the URL into the address bar. (**Note**: don't close the terminal as we have started an interactive JupyterLab session, which will be terminated once you close your terminal. You can stop the interactive session by pressing "CTRL + C".)
- You can now work with notebooks (".ipynb" format) in JupyterLab and follow the hands-on python sessions. All packages that you will need during the Python classes are defined in the "environment.yml" file and have therefore been installed in your conda environment called "intor-to-cs". Since we started the JupyterLab session from within this environment, you have now access to all required packages.

## 1.7 Introduction to Python

- Now that we have started a JupyterLab session, open the notebook **"1.Intro to Python"** in the **"lecture1"** folder from your JupyterLab browser application. Then, go through the notebook by following the instructions written directly in the markdown cells of this notebook.

## 1.4 Summary Remarks

Congratulations on making it until here! You have learned a great deal about different useful data science tools that can be leveraged to efficiently run analyses with your data and you have installed these tools on your local workstation so that you can use them for this class and your future projects. In addition, you have taken your first steps to learn Python, one of the most powerful general-purpose programming languages and the leading programming language among data scientists. Thanks to our conda environment, you will have all required Python packages to your availability and the only thing you have to worry about is activating the environment and running JupyterLab from within the environment.
